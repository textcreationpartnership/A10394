         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Vpon conſideration of this that hath beene ſaid. I haue afforded my helpe to the bringing forth of this enſuing Treatiſe, a worthy and excellent worke, of a learned and faithfull ſeruant of God (not long ſince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed) well knowne to you and me. The excellency of it wil appeare, firſt if the particulars therin intreated of, be but generally conſidered; as firſt, the ſpirituall Communion or coniunction that is betwixt God and the faithfull. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the bond of this coniunction, the loue of God. Thirdly, the ground of this coniunction, Chriſt Ieſus. Fourthly, the ſpeciall intereſt the faithfull haue in him, and he in them. Fiftly, the certainty of the ſpirituall ſafety of Gods children amidſt all dangers, and againſt al commers. Sixtly, the aſſurance the faithfull haue, and may haue, in this life, of Gods loue, and ſo of ſaluation. Seauenthly, the Chriſtian mans bearing of himſelfe vp in, and againſt all danger, vpon this aſſurance, with a declaration and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of diuers of our enemies, and what they can doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs: If theſe be not excellent theames, I know not what are. Secondly, the excellency of this worke will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare if the ſtrict and yet plaine and eaſie methode which is vſed therein, be conſidered, which will make it delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to euery one that readeth it, methode being to the

Thirdly, the excellency of this Treatiſe will appeare, if we conſider the ſeaſonableneſſe of its birth: It is borne, and commeth forth in due time; For it entreateth at large of the afflictions &amp; dangers to which the faithfull are, and may be, ſubiect in this world, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth them with matter of ſupport, in, and againſt them all. And when, or in what time could this Argument bee more ſeaſonable then now, and at this time, wherein the Church and people of God are in ſuch diſtreſſe, hazard, and danger, and the deſtroying Angell of God is ſo abroad in many places of the world, and all places almoſt filled with warres, and rumors of warres, and who knoweth when theſe things ſhall end? Fourthly, the excellency of this Treatiſe will appeare, if we conſider the fitneſſe of, and the enablements wherewith this man was enabled to write and ſpeake of this Subiect, which were very great and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, whether we conſider the endowments of Learning, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, grace, or experience; for beſides the three former, he was a man experienced in afflictions, being then, when he ſtudied, writ, and preached theſe following Sermons, and for the ſpace of many yeares before, a man of many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and of greiuous, and of heauy afflictions, by which (through the gracious bleſſing and worke of Gods ſpirit) he was made (as holyer and better, ſo) fitter to write and ſpeake of the nature, kindes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> degrees, and effects of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and afflictions, and of what they can doe, and of the ſupports in them, &amp; againſt them. For, as euery man is beſt able to ſpeake, and diſcourſe of that profeſſion, and the Myſteries thereof, of which he is <note n="d" place="margin">Nauita de ventis, de tauris narrat arator, enumerat miles vulnera, paſtor oues. <hi>Propert.</hi>
               </note>, ſo is that man that is, and hath beene long a man of troubles, fitteſt to write and ſpeake of them, and of all things belonging to them. That this man was, (both then when he writ, and ſpake
<pb facs="tcp:2715:4"/>
theſe Sermons, and had beene for long time before) a man of troubles, and heauy afflictions, beſides the teſtimony of all that knew him, his owne words (which I finde written with his owne hand in his booke, by way of Preface to theſe following Sermons) doe plainely ſhew, his words are theſe: After a heauy burthen, of many heauy infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſore afflictions, and hideous temptations, long endured, and ſtill continuing vpon me, I am come forth once againe to ſpeake in this place, not in any ſence of ſtrength recouered, nor yet in any liuely hope of any abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to goe through with this great worke, but onely in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Gods commandement, who hath now brought mee, I know not how, vnto this ſeruice, and in faith alone. This Treatiſe (excellent as aforeſaid in ſo many reſpects) I haue beene mooued to Dedicate to you M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Doctor, and to you the reſt of my louing friends, for three reaſons. Firſt, becauſe I conceiue that it doth more properly belong vnto you, then to any other, for, to whom ſhould it belong, if not to you, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Doctor, who ſucceed the Author of it in his paſtorall charge? whereby you may ſee how &amp; with what kinde of nouriſhment, he fed his, now your people: And to what people doth it more properly belong, then to you my louing friends, for whom it was firſt conceiued, ſtudyed, penned, and preached? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that I might manifeſt my intire loue and hearty wel-wiſhing to you all, amongſt whom I haue exerciſed my Miniſtery for the ſpace of nine yeares laſt paſt, and ſtill doe by the mercy of God. Thirdly, that I might bee a meanes of further knitting, and continuing you in vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned loue one towards another, by ioyning you together in this Dedication of this worke, whom God hath, by his ſpeciall prouidence, ioyned together in that neere band of relation, of Paſtor and people. That this may be, and that you, and all others to whom this Treatiſe ſhall come, may gaine, as much ſpirituall good, as the Author, in ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying, penning, and preaching, and I in publiſhing deſire,

I doe, and will pray to him that is the God of loue, and the giuer of all good things, and that through him who is the Sonne of his loue, and the meanes and way of all good things to vs, euen the Lord Ieſus,</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or I am perſwaded, (or I am ſure, &amp;c.)</hi> It being the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary portion of all Gods children to ſuffer many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions in this life; It was therefore the ordinary pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter comfort and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to all Gods children, againſt all their ſufferings. Thus the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here in this place to comfort himſelfe, and the faithfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all afflictions, propounds two conſiderations: Firſt, what the afflictions are that may befall Gods children; Secondly what harme they can doe them. And this he doth from the 35. verſe. Firſt, what the afflictions are that Gods children are ſubiect to in this life; and they are of all ſorts, ſore and heauy, Tribulation, Diſtreſſe, Perſecution, Famine, Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Perill, Sword, &amp;c. Secondly, what harme can they doe to Gods children? He doth not exempt vs from any bodily dangers, (for therein wee are as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2715:6"/>
other men) but they cannot endanger our ſpirituall eſtate, to depriue vs of that, they cannot ſeperate vs from the loue of God, which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord, for ſo the queſtion intends, <hi>verſe 35. Who ſhall ſeperate vs from the loue of Chriſt?</hi> ſhal Tribulation, or Diſtreſſe? As who ſhould ſay, nothing can: No, they are ſo farre from doing vs harme in our ſpirituall eſtate, as that contrariwiſe, we are much the better for them, in that kinde: <hi>In all theſe things wee are conquerors, and more then conquerors, through him that loued vs, verſe 37.</hi> And hereupon the Apoſtle growes to a peremptory reſolution, and determines the matter clearely, both on his owne part, and on the part of all the faithfull, <hi>That neither life, nor death, nor Angels, nor Principalities, &amp;c. ſhall euer ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate vs from the loue of God, which is in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus our Lord, verſe 38.39.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The parts of this Scripture are two: Firſt the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles reſolution, <hi>that neither life nor death, &amp;c. ſhall euer ſeperate him from the loue of God:</hi> Secondly, his proteſtation of this his reſolution, <hi>I am perſwaded (or I am ſure of it.</hi> Firſt, the Apoſtles reſolution, <hi>that nothing ſhall ſeperate him, &amp;c.</hi> The ſubſtance and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect whereof is this; that true beleeuers can neuer fall away vtterly from grace; which he expreſſeth in theſe termes, <hi>that nothing can ſeperate vs, &amp;c.</hi> So long as God loues vs, we can neuer vtterly fall away from grace: But God loues vs alwayes; nothing can ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate vs from his loue: Therefore we can neuer vtterly fall away from grace. And that he might not ſeeme to ſpeake vnaduiſedly, or raſhly, he knowes not what, therefore he caſts vp his reckoning before-hand, as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2715:7"/>
the wiſe King doth before he vndertakes War, <hi>Luke 14.31.</hi> So doth the Apoſtle, foreſee and ſet before his eies, all the cauſes &amp; dangers of falling away that may be thought of, &amp; then heartens himſelfe againſt them all, <hi>againſt death, againſt life, againſt Angels, &amp;c.</hi> and againſt all commers; neuer ſhall <hi>any thing ſeperate vs from the loue of God, neither death, nor life,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: What danger ſoeuer befals vs, it befals vs either in our life, or in our death, but neither in <hi>death, nor in life, ſhall any thing ſeperate vs,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle,) therefore nothing can: Yea, but yet wee may be ouermatched with mighty enemies, which are too ſtrong for vs, <hi>as Angels, Principalities, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>; the Apoſtle continues his reſolution, that God is infinitely more ſtrong and mighty to ſaue vs, then all our enemies are to deſtroy vs, and therefore ſaith, <hi>nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, ſhall euer preuaile againſt vs:</hi> Yea, but though our preſent ſtate be good enough, yet things to come are vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine; We know not yet how hardly we may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead hereafter vpon our death-beds, &amp;c. But ſaith the Apoſtle, all ſhall be well then too, our God is not a God a farre off, but at hand too; our louing God is not onely for the time preſent, but for the time to come, euen for all eternity, his loue neuer changeth: And therefore as our ſtate is good for the preſent, ſo it is for the time to come, God hath ſecured vs for that too, <hi>neither things preſent, nor things to come:</hi> Yea, but there is a great <hi>height</hi> aboue vs, we may bee ſnatched vp of that, and a great <hi>depth</hi> below vs, wee may be ſwallowed vp of that: No, ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, our God that loues vs, rules in all things, both in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2715:7"/>
the <hi>higheſt heights,</hi> and in the <hi>loweſt depths</hi> that are, and therefore it is neither the <hi>height</hi> of <hi>Heauen,</hi> nor the <hi>depth</hi> of <hi>Hell that can ſeparate vs:</hi> Yea, but there are infinite Creatures in the world, and wee know not what miſchiefe they may doe vs: but ſaith the Apoſtle, they are but Creatures, and therefore in the hands and diſpoſing of God their Creator, who is our louing Father in Chriſt Ieſus, and therefore not any one of them can, nor all of them together ſhall, <hi>be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſeparate vs, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſecondly of his proteſtation, <hi>I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or I am ſure of it.</hi> It is not a bare conceit, but a full perſwaſion in me: I doe not goe by thinkings and gueſſings, but vpon a ſure ground, I am ſure of it, and here I make it knowne to all the world, bee it knowne to the faithfull, for their comfort and reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing; be it knowne to the wicked, for their terrour and aſtoniſhment; be it knowne to the Angels in heauen; and be it knowne to the Diuels in hell, that I am perſwaded, that I am confident in it, <hi>that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther death nor life, &amp;c. Oh Paul,</hi> great was thy faith! Oh thou beleeuing Man or Woman whatſoeuer thou art, labour and ſtriue thou to get this perſwaſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy heart, and if thou canſt not get this full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion which was in the Apoſtle, yet labour to be a true Beleeuer, make ſure worke for that, and then <hi>Paul</hi> doth here aſſure thee, as himſelfe, that neither <hi>death, nor life, &amp;c ſhall euer be able to ſeparate thee from the loue of God in Chriſt Ieſus</hi>; for <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſpeake this onely in particular of <hi>himſelfe,</hi> but of <hi>vs,</hi> putting it the caſe of euery beleeuing Man and Woman: He ſaith not nothing can ſeparate <hi>mee,</hi> but
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2715:8"/>
                  <hi>vs:</hi> that is, all the faithfull: and ſurely hee had the Spirit, and could not be deceiued, and therefore what was his caſe, is ours. I am ſure, not any thing can ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate me; and I am ſure not any thing ſhall ſeperate them, whoſoeuer they be, that haue ſauing faith: For <hi>I am perſwaded,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that neither death nor life, nor Angels, &amp;c. ſhall be able to ſeparate vs from the loue of God which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for my more orderly proceeding, and your better vnderſtanding, I will caſt this Scripture into this mould; The whole ſubſtance of the Text doth ſpend and empty it ſelfe into theſe ſeauen parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars: Firſt, is a matter of Implication, and that is, that there is a Communion or Coniunction betwixt God and the faithfull; Separation preſuppoſeth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction: when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>nothing can ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate vs from God,</hi> it is neceſſarily implyed, that there is a Coniunction betwixt God and vs: for things that were neuer ioyned together, cannot be ſaid to be ſeparated one from the other. Then ſecondly, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth the Bond of this Coniunction, and that is the <hi>loue of God.</hi> Thirdly, he ſhewes the ground and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this Bond and Coniunction, and that is, <hi>Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.</hi> Fourthly, he declares a ſpeciall Intereſt that the faithfull haue in Chriſt Ieſus, by a note of neere and ſpeciall reference betwixt Chriſt and the faithfull, <hi>our Lord.</hi> Fiftly, the Apoſtle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoucheth the certainty of the ſafety of Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren amidſt all dangers, <hi>nothing can ſeparate vs:</hi> and this hee enlargeth in many particular dangers, euen the greateſt that can be imagined, <hi>Death, life &amp;c.</hi> Sixtly, he proteſts his Confidence which hee hath
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2715:8"/>
concerning this their ſafety, as being the vndoubted truth of God, <hi>I am perſwaded, (or I am ſure, &amp;c.</hi>) Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenthly, he beares vp himſelfe boldly vpon this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, againſt all afflictions and dangers that euer did, or euer could, befall him, for this is the maine drift of this whole diſcourſe, being propounded by way of a Reaſon, <hi>for I am ſure</hi>: Why doth he inſult o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all theſe? Becauſe hee is ſure, and bold againſt them all.</p>
               <p>Now to the particulars,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> and firſt for the matter of Implication: The Doctrine is this. All true beleeuers are ioyned to God in Chriſt, and haue a gracious and an holy and ſpirituall Communion and fellowſhip with him. The point is but implyed here, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt not be very large in it; but yet becauſe it is ſo implyed as being one ſpeciall meanes of our ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding faſt in the ſtate of Grace, it muſt not be left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toucht, nor yet too ſparingly handled. It is a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine hard to be vnderſtood, and I dare ſay, it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the capacity of man to vnderſtand it in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of it: I ſay it is hard to be vnderſtood, but it is harder to be beleeued, but hardeſt of all to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed; we will ſpeake ſomewhat of it therefore; firſt, by way of Explication, that ſo we may the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it: ſecondly, ſomewhat by way of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that we may the better beleeue it: thirdly, ſomewhat by way of Application, that wee may the better practiſe it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for Explication,<note place="margin">Explication.</note> there is a twofold Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, one generall, the other ſpeciall: the generall is common to all the Creatures; all haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, <hi>they in him, and he in them; they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2715:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in him as their Creator, he in them, as his Creatures:</hi> And this communion they haue with God in Chriſt too, <hi>who is the firſt begotten of euery Creature, and in him all things conſiſt, Coloſ.</hi> 1.15.17. as if he ſhould ſay, Chriſt hath Communion with God, for hee is the <hi>Image of the inuiſible God</hi>: the Creatures haue communion with Chriſt, for <hi>hee is the firſt begotten of euery Creature, and in him all conſiſt</hi>; and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, all the Creatures haue ſome kinde of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God. The ſpeciall Communion is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, either that Communion which the Angels haue with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or that men haue with God; the firſt wee will let paſſe as not ſo incident to the point in hand: For the ſecond, the Communion which men haue with God, it is of two ſorts alſo, generall or ſpeciall: Generall, which all men haue with God by nature, as men, for Chriſt hauing taken vpon him the whole nature of mankinde, all men doe Communicate with him; as he is man they partake with him, and he with them, as man with man, as the Apoſtle-ſhewes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>For as much as the Children were partakers of fleſh and bloud, hee alſo himſelfe likewiſe tooke part with them, &amp;c.</hi> The ſpeciall Communion is that which we haue with God through Chriſt by grace, and this likewiſe is of two ſorts, either in the outward meanes, or in the inward truth of grace: In the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward meanes of grace, and this is the caſe of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Goſpell, that are outwardly called to the Communion of the word and of the Sacraments, they haue Communion with God in Chriſt, in reſpect of the outward meanes of grace, and are reputed mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſts Body, and this they haue, as Chriſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2715:9"/>
is head of the Church viſible. In the inward truth of grace; and this is proper and peculiar to the faithfull onely, that are effectually called, and by faith truely ingrafted into Chriſt; and this Communion they haue with God in Chriſt, as Chriſt is the head of the Church inuiſible, that is, of the whole company of Gods choſen, and this is the true Communion here intended: Vnderſtand it thus; God loues his choſen freely in Chriſt Ieſus; and in his loue, giues his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to his choſen; by his Spirit, hee workes faith into their hearts; by faith Chriſt dwels within them, and is made one with them, and they with him, and ſo in him they are made one with God: ſo then, if yee aske me what this Communion is, I ſay it is our v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting or ioyning to God; If yee aske me who are the perſons that are ioyned? they are true Beleeuers, all they, and none elſe; If ye aske me, in whom they are ioyned? I ſay in Chriſt Ieſus. Laſtly, if yee aske mee what manner of Communion this is? I ſay, it is by grace, and by the Spirit, and therefore it is a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and holy Communion: and ſo you haue the whole Doctrine, and euery branch of it plainely clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and opened. So much for Explication.</p>
               <p>Now ſecondly for Confirmation,<note place="margin">Confirmation. 1. By Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> and that ſhall be both by Scriptures and Reaſons: Firſt by Scripture, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>We are made partakers of the godly (or diuine) nature, &amp;c.</hi> True Beleeuers are not onely made partakers of Gods bleſſings, or of his guifts, but of Gods nature and being: And how? not by way of partition, as if ſome part of the godly Nature were taken from God, and giuen to vs, for that is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, the diuine nature can neuer be deuided; but by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2715:10"/>
way of Communion, as communicating in the nature of God by a bleſſed vnion, <hi>1 Cor. 6.17. Hee that is ioyned to the Lord, is one Spirit.</hi> The Apoſtle here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes two things of euery true beleeuer; Firſt, that euery true Beleeuer is ioyned or glewed to the Lord, as the word ſignifies; Secondly, the proceede of it, and that is this, that they are one Spirit: Euery true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer is ioyned or glewed to the Lord; there is our Coniunction: Euery Beleeuer that is ioyned to the Lord, is one Spirit; there is the proceede of this Coniunction, euen to an holy and ſound Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Scripture ſpeakes yet more particularly, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, that we are not onely ioyned to Gods being and nature, but to euery perſon in the God-head: This bleſſed Communion is made betwixt vs and the whole bleſſed Trinity, the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, as in the <hi>1</hi> of <hi>Iohn 1.3. Our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> there is our Communion with the Father, and with the Sonne. <hi>1 Cor. 1.9. Yee were called vnto the fellowſhip of his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt</hi>: there is our Communion with the Sonne: and in the <hi>2 Cor. 13.13. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the holy Ghoſt be with you all, &amp;c.</hi> there is our Communion with the holy Ghoſt: We haue this Communion therefore with God the Father, God the Sonne, and God the holy Ghoſt. In preciſe tearmes take it thus; wee haue a Communion with God in Chriſt, through the Spirit: God the Father is the ſubiect to whom wee are vnited; Chriſt is the Mediator in whom we are vnited; the Holy Spirit is the worker by whom we are thus ioyned and vnited. God loues vs freely, and in his loue, giues vs his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2715:10"/>
and thereby workes faith in our hearts, and by Faith, and by the Spirit, Chriſt is made one with vs, and we with him, and in him wee are made one with God. So much for proofes by Scripture.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons why there is ſuch a Communion of the faithfull with God, are theſe. The firſt reaſon is,<note place="margin">Confirmation by Reaſons.</note>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> the <hi>Loue of God to them.</hi> Ezek. 16.8. <hi>When I paſſed by thee, and looked vpon thee, behold thy time was the time of loue, and I ſpread my skirt ouer thee, and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thy nakedneſſe, yea I ſware vnto thee, and entred into a couenant with thee, ſaith the Lord God, and thou becameſt mine.</hi> What is the reaſon that the Lord did all this for his people? It was his loue, <hi>it was the time of loue,</hi> and therefore he did ioyne them to himſelfe, and made them his. Yet further, our Communion with God in Chriſt, is compared to a <hi>Marriage,</hi> in Scripture, <hi>Hoſea 2.19.23. Epheſ. 5.31.32.</hi> Now why doth a Man marry a Woman? Is it not becauſe he loues her? elſe hee diſſembles; but God cannot diſſemble: And therefore the maine reaſon why God marries vs, and makes vs one with himſelfe, is this, becauſe he loues vs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the mediation of Chriſt makes this Communion, God is in Chriſt, and the Beleeuer is in Chriſt, and there is the Communion, the Beleeuer is one with God in Chriſt: Chriſt by his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes this Communion, by his interceſſion he procures it, and by his death he doth purchaſe it, and by our ſanctification, he applyes it, and makes it ours. By his Incarnation hee makes it: For Chriſt being God, and comming downe, and taking our nature vpon him, and becomes man, then there is <hi>Emanuel,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2715:11"/>
God with vs, Matth. 1.23.</hi> not onely God with Chriſt, as hee being made one with God, <hi>but God with vs,</hi> as we through Chriſt being made one with God, and he with vs. Secondly, in his Interceſſion, he procures it, as <hi>Ioh. 17.20.21.22. Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo that ſhall beleeue in me through their word, that they may all be one, as thou Father art in mee, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in vs:</hi> Here Chriſt prayes for all true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers, and what is his requeſt? <hi>that they all may be one, &amp;c.</hi> that is, there may be an <hi>holy Communion,</hi> not onely betwixt themſelues, but betwixt them and God alſo, and ſurely Chriſts prayer was neuer denyed, <hi>but God heares him alwaies, Iohn 11.42.</hi> therefore if he hath prayed for it, he hath procured it. Thirdly, by his death he purchaſed it, <hi>Reu. 5.9. Thou haſt redeemed vs to God by thy blood, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſt hath bought vs, and paide dearely for vs, euen his owne precious bloud, and whom hath he bought vs to? <hi>to God,</hi> that we might be his, that is, that hee may own vs as his people, and that we may own him as our God. Fourthly, he applyes it to vs, and makes it ours in our <hi>Sanctification, Heb. 2.11. For both hee that ſanctifieth, and they which are ſanctified, are all one:</hi> Til we are ſanctified we are neuer truly ioyned to God, but when once we are ſanctified, that is, when we begin to be truly holy in our harts, &amp; in our liues, then are we already admitted into this bleſſed Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt, and ſo with God; then hee that doth ſanctifie, and they that are ſanctified, are all one.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>3</label> Thirdly, the Bond of the Spirit is another reaſon of it: Gods Spirit hath a ſpeciall intercourſe, and doth
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2715:11"/>
mannage this whole buſineſſe betwixt God and vs, <hi>Gal. 4.6. God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Sonne into our hearts, crying Abba Father:</hi> God ſends his Spirit into our hearts, thereby God Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates with vs, as with his Sonnes: By this Spirit we cry <hi>Abba Father,</hi> and thereby we Communicate with God as with our heauenly Father, there is Gods Communion with vs, and ours with him: All the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of Gods Communion with vs, are carried by his Spirit: If he teach vs, hee doth it by his Spirit, if he comforts vs, he comforts vs by his Spirit, if hee adopt vs, he adopts vs by his Spirit, if hee ſeales vs, if he ſanctifies vs, hee doth it by his Spirit; whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer God doth to vs in this Communion, hee doth it all by his Spirit: And on the other ſide, all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of our Communion with God, are carried by his Spirit; If we pray, we pray by the Spirit; if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, we doe it by the Spirit; if we loue God, if wee obey God, we doe it by the Spirit; that wee pray to God, that we beleeue in God, that we hope in God, loue, and obey God, it is all by the Spirit of God, there is one and the ſame Spirit in God, and in vs: therefore the Bond of the Spirit is one ſpeciall cauſe of this Communion which we haue with God.</p>
               <p>The laſt Reaſon is from the nature of faith, which <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>4</label> is of this Nature, that it vnites and ioynes the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect or perſon beleeuing, to the obiect or thing belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and makes them one, <hi>By faith we are ingrafted into Chriſt, Rom. 11.19.20.</hi> As a Syence is ingrafted into a Stocke, and as that growes to be one with the ſtocke, ſo is the ſoule that is ingrafted into Chriſt, it growes one with Chriſt; <hi>Chriſt dwels in our hearts
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2715:12"/>
by faith, Epheſ. 3.17.</hi> And that is a bleſſed Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and coniunction betwixt Chriſt and the true beleeuer. If we beleeue, preſently we haue poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt in our hearts, <hi>an holy and an heauenly gift: By faith we eatethe fleſh of Chriſt, and drink his blood, Iohn 6.47.54. And whoſoeuer eateth Chriſts fleſh, and drinketh his blood, he liues in Chriſt, and Chriſt in him, verſ. 57.</hi> Here is an holy and an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Communion. See the liuely experience of this vniting power of faith in the caſe of <hi>Thomas, Ioh. 20.27.28.</hi> he would not beleeue, our Sauiour perſwades him to be ruled by him, and not to be obſtinate, <hi>not to be faithleſſe, but faithfull</hi>; ſo ſoone as euer he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, he cryes out, <hi>My Lord, and my God</hi>; ſo that by beleeuing in God, God becomes our God, and by beleeuing in the Lord, the Lord becomes our Lord; he is ours, and we are his; this makes the vnion: And ſo much be ſpoken for matter of Confirmation.</p>

God, hee hath an accurſed Communion with the Diuell, there is no middle betwixt them: Therefore lay thy hand vpon thy heart, and examine thy ſelfe what Communion thou haſt with God in Chriſt, what knowledge &amp; what faith thou haſt: Doſt thou know God in Chriſt? doſt thou beleeue in God through Chriſt? doſt thou worſhip God in Chriſt? and all this in truth of thy heart? then thou mayeſt be well aſſured that thou art ioyned to God in Chriſt, elſe thou art without Chriſt, and ſo without God. To giue you a ſure and true Rule for this Tryall, which if you doe duely conſider, will neuer deceiue you; there are two infallible Euidences of this Communion, the Spirit, and the fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: Firſt, the Spirit, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.13. <hi>Hereby wee know that we dwell in him, and he in vs, becauſe he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs of his Spirit:</hi> The Apoſtle makes this a certain Note of our Communion, and therefore if wee haue the Spirit we are ſure of it: Yea, but we may flatter our ſelues, that we haue the Spirit when we haue it not? that is true, but that is their owne Errour and preſumption that doe ſo: but yet if thou doeſt make a Trade of this Examination, thou ſhalt finde in time, that thou doeſt know it of a Truth: Hee that hath the Spirit indeed, knowes it as certainly, as he knowes he liues; onely by practiſe, experience, and prayer, this is brought to paſſe. Secondly, the fruits of the Spirit, (I will name but two,) <hi>Mortification,</hi> and <hi>Quickning</hi>; Mortifying the old man, &amp; quickening of the new man, theſe are two infallible Euidences of our Communion with God: Firſt, Mortification, <hi>Gal. 5.24.

Againe, examine thy ſelfe what fruits of the Spirit are in thee; what mortification haſt thou? doeſt thou ſtriue againſt thy corruptions? doeſt thou mortifie thy earthly luſts? doeſt thou finde that ſin dyes, and thy ſecret corruptions waſte and conſume daily in thee? If thou doeſt, then haſt thou a bleſſed Communion with Chriſt Ieſus in his death; for it is by the power of his death that this is wrought in thee. Secondly, what quickening haſt thou? what newneſſe of heart and life? what zeale for Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? what delight in Gods Commandements? what comfort haſt thou in prayer? what care and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence haſt thou to leade a godly life? &amp;c. If thou fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt theſe things in thee, then thou haſt a bleſſed Communion with Chriſt in his reſurrection; for this is our Communion with Chriſt, to communicate with him both in his death and in his Reſurrection, and both theſe haue we by his Spirit; but if thou doſt not finde theſe things in thee, certainely as yet thou art in a miſerable caſe.</p>

               <p>Now we are to come to the ſecond point,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Doct.</hi>
                  </note> the Bond of this holy Communion betwixt God and vs, and that is, <hi>the loue of God.</hi> The Doctrine is this, that the Bond of that holy Communion which is betwixt God and true Beleeuers, is Gods loue to them. The Bond of that holy Communion which true Beleeuers haue with God in Chriſt, is the loue of God. The Doctrine ariſeth thus, the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilitie of ſeperating vs from God, or from our Communion with God, expreſſeth it thus; nothing can ſeperate vs from the loue of God, thereby giuing vs plainely to vnderſtand, that the Bond whereby we are ſo faſt ioyned to God in Chriſt ſo as nothing can ſeperate vs, is this, the loue of God towards vs.<note place="margin">Explication, conſiſting in three queſtions and anſweres.</note> I will ſpeake ſomewhat by way of Explication; and certaine queſtions there are to be propounded and anſwered therein. The firſt queſtion is, whether this loue of God here ſpoken or, may not be meant of our loue to God, as well as of his loue to vs, for ſo ſome expound it? and it agrees well with the phraſe, for ſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Scripture, the loue of God is taken for Gods
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:2715:18"/>
loue to vs, and ſometime for our loue to God: And alſo it agrees well with the drift of this place, which is to ſhew the certainty of the faithfull in the ſtate of grace, not onely that nothing can remoue God from vs, that he ſhould ceaſe to loue vs; but alſo that nothing ſhall remoue vs from God, that wee ſhould ceaſe to loue him. And it agrees well with the Nature of our Communion with God; for this being a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Communion, as well on our part with God, as on his part with vs (for, as he ſaith to vs, <hi>thou art my People,</hi> ſo, we ſay to him, <hi>thou art my God, Hoſea 2.23.</hi>) therefore there is neceſſary vſe as well of our loue to him, as of his to vs, for the vpholding of this Communion. I anſwere, the loue of God here ſpoken of is meant directly &amp; properly of Gods loue to vs, &amp; not of our loue to God; for it muſt be vnderſtood of ſuch a loue that neuer failes; but alas our loue to God doth faile many times, but Gods loue to vs neuer failes: therefore it muſt be meant of Gods loue to vs, &amp; not of our loue to God: there is indeed a great vſe, &amp; an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity of our loue to God, &amp; ſo it is true that God will neuer ſuffer our loue to fall vtterly from him, and ſo conſequently it is true that nothing ſhall vtterly ſeperate vs from our loue to him: Yea, but that is not the <hi>drift</hi> of the place, for the force and power of our vnſeperable Coniunction with God, doth not ſtand vpon the weake hold of our loue to God, but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſtrong &amp; vnmoueable hold of Gods loue to vs.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Queſtion is, that ſeeing it is meant of Gods loue to vs, then what kinde of Gods loue to the faithfull is here ſpoken of? I anſwere, there is a threefold loue which God beares to all true Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2715:18"/>
Firſt, God loues his children with a generall loue, as they are his Creatures, the worke of his owne hands, and ſo he hates nothing that hee hath made; and this is a prouiding loue for their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and preſeruation, and this hee ſhewes in our daily Foode and Rayment, and neceſſaries for this life. Secondly, he loues them with a ſpeciall loue, as men, or as they are of the Nature of mankinde, for the Nature of man is a louely thing in the eyes of God; and this is a countenancing loue, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement and honour of mankinde; and this loue God ſhewed ſpecially in the Incarnation of Chriſt, when the nature of man was aſſumed into the perſon of the Sonne of God. The third is a particular loue which he beares to them as they are his Children and true Beleeuers, for a true beleeuing <hi>Saul</hi> is a moſt pretious Iewell before the Lord; and this is a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing loue, for their grace and glory: and this hee ſhewes in making vs one with himſelfe inſeperably, and for euer; and this loue it is, that is here ſpoken of, Nothing ſhall ſeperate vs from the ſauing loue of God for grace and glory.</p>
               <p>The third Queſtion is, why it is called a <hi>Bond</hi>: The anſwere is, becauſe it performes ſuch Offices in this caſe, as a Bond doth; for firſt, a Bond ſerues to ioyne and tye things together into one Bundle; and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, being ſo tyed, it keepes them faſt together, ſo that till the Bond be broken, or taken off (as wee ſee in a faggot or a ſheafe) they are neuer ſundred; ſo is Gods loue in this bleſſed vnion, it ioynes together, and till it ſelfe faile, (which can neuer be) it holds vs faſt to God for euer. Theſe things rightly vnderſtood, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2715:19"/>

The proofes of the Doctrine are theſe,<note place="margin">Proofes, or confirmation, 1. by Scripture</note> 
                  <hi>Ier. 31.3.</hi> the end of the Verſe. <hi>I haue loued thee with an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting loue, therefore with mercy haue I drawne thee:</hi> It is Gods owne ſpeech to his owne people, wherein firſt he profeſſeth his loue; <hi>I haue loued thee, &amp;c.</hi> And then he ſhewes the fruits of his loue, <hi>therefore with mercy haue I drawne thee, &amp;c.</hi> The Lord ſhewes mercy vnto vs, and in mercy drawes vs vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, into a bleſſed Communion with his owne Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty; but what is the Bond whereby he drawes vs? It is his loue to vs, I haue <hi>loued thee,</hi> therefore, &amp;c. <hi>Hoſea 11.1.4. When Iſrael was a Childe, then I loued him, and called my Sonne out of Egypt</hi>; God cals vs out of the Egyptian darkeneſſe of Sinne and Death, and Hell, and takes vs to be his owne Children, his Sonnes and Daughters; but whence comes it that he enters into this league with vs? <hi>It is from his loue, I haue loued him, &amp;c.</hi> then in the fourth Verſe, <hi>I leade them with Cords of man, euen with Bonds of Loue,</hi> where the Holy Ghoſt ſpeakes expreſly to the point in hand, that the Bonds whereby God leades along in the wayes of ſaluation, are the Bonds of Loue, <hi>Cant. 2 4. He brought mee into the Wine-Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and Loue was his Banner ouer me; He brought me into his Wine-Cellar,</hi> there the Spouſe (euery true beleeuing Soule) ſpeakes of the ſweet intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt and her; <hi>brought me into his Wine-Cellar,</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:2715:19"/>
that is, made me partaker, of his ſpirituall, ſweet, and heauenly comforts, for that is meant by wine; <hi>and loue was his Banner,</hi> what is the vſe of a Banner? It is to gather together the Souldiers to the Company and Captaine to whom they doe belong: Gods Banner ouer his people, is his lone, It is the loue of God to his, that gathers all true beleeuers together vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Ieſus Chriſt, he being their Captaine, and they his Souldiers to ſerue vnder his Colours; Oh this is a ſweet ſeruice, to ſerue and to fight vnder the Colours and Banner of the loue of God in Ieſus Chriſt! <hi>Iohn 3.16. God ſo loued the world, that he gaue his onely begotten Sonne, that whoſoeuer beleeueth in him ſhould not periſh, but haue eternall life:</hi> God hath giuen vs his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, that by faith wee might beleeue in him, and haue Communion with him, and hee that doth beleeue in him ſhall neuer periſh, but haue eternall life: And whence is all this? from his loue, there is no bond to tye God to doe this for vs, but <hi>onely his loue to vs, God ſo loued the world, &amp;c. Iohn 17.23. I in them and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that thou haſt ſent me, and haſt loued them as thou haſt loued mee:</hi> That Chriſt is in vs, and God in Chriſt, and that all the faithfull haue a perfect Communion with God in Chriſt. Theſe are plaine Euidences to the eye of the world; that God hath ſent his Sonne to vs, and that he hath loued vs (in ſome meaſure) as he loues Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and that this loue was the cauſe, why he did all this for vs: So much for proofes of Scripture to confirme this point.</p>

Thirdly, thou maiſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> know it by thy loue to GOD, if thou loue GOD, it is moſt certaine that he loues thee, and if God loues thee, thou canſt not but loue God: But how may I know certainely that I loue God indeed, for I may be deceiued in this, as well as in the other?

Afflictions are ſo indeed, but chaſtiſements are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to Gods people onely: But how ſhall I know whether mine be chaſtiſements?

The Doctrine may ſeeme plaine enough at the firſt ſight, and ſo it is; yet that we may rightly and ſoundly comprehend it, or rather be comprehended by it,<note place="margin">Explication.</note> it needes ſome Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: Firſt of the names, <hi>Chriſt Ieſus; Chriſt</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the annointed; <hi>Ieſus</hi> ſignifies a Sauiour, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he is called in Scripture, ſometimes by the name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> onely, and ſometime by the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> onely, the Apoſtle here ioynes them both together, <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi>; thereby to ſet forth the perfection and fulneſſe of Gods loue to vs in his Sonne. <hi>Ieſus</hi> is the name of his Perſon; <hi>Chriſt</hi> the name of his Office, he is called Chriſt reſpectiuely to God, by whom he is annointed, he is the Lords annointed: and hee is called <hi>Ieſus</hi> in reſpect of vs, whom he comes to ſaue, he is our <hi>Ieſus,</hi> our <hi>Sauiour</hi>: Behold, how compleat
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2715:27"/>
and perfect Gods loue to vs in Chriſt is? Hee loues vs in his perſon, he loues vs in his office, he loues vs in his <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and in our <hi>Ieſus,</hi> in his annointed, and in our Sauiour, How could he deuiſe to loue vs more, then is meant and contained in theſe words, that God <hi>loues vs in Chriſt Ieſus?</hi> Secondly, we are to ſpeake ſomewhat of the phraſe in Chriſt Ieſus, which is to be receiued vnder a diſtinction, for there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the actions of Gods loue to vs <hi>in his Sonne:</hi> I ſay a difference in reſpect of our Senſe, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Gods loue it ſelfe: Some actions of Gods loue to vs, are ſo in Chriſt, that they are wholly ſuſpended on Chriſt, and his merits are the onely procuring cauſe of them: As for example, forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, is an action of Gods loue to vs, and yet this wholly depends on Chriſt and his merits; that his precious bloud muſt procure this mercy for vs from God, elſe they will neuer be forgiuen; and this and the like loue of God, is both in Chriſt and for Chriſt. There are ſome other actions of Gods loue which ariſe meerely and onely out of the abſolute will of God, without any concurrance of Chriſts merits; As the eternall purpoſe of God, whereby hee hath determined to chuſe ſome men to ſaluation; this is an action of Gods loue meerely, riſing out of his abſolute will, without Chriſts merits, for Chriſt is a Mediator, and all his merits are the effects of his loue, not the cauſe of it; and yet this loue though it be not for Chriſt, yet is it in Chriſt too, <hi>Epheſ. 3.11. according to the eternall purpoſe which hee wrought in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> that is, in regard of the execution of it, for euen this eternall purpoſe, and all the actions of Gods loue which ariſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2715:27"/>
from his abſolute will, are effected and brought to paſſe, in, and through Chriſt. This diſtinction wee muſt here vndergoe, that ſo God may haue his right, and Chriſt may haue his right; that we may honor the Father ſo, as that we may alſo honour the Sonne; and the Sonne ſo, as that the Father may not looſe his honour, that ſo the abſoluteneſſe of the loue of God, and the Mediation of Chriſt, may not impeach one another. Thirdly, we muſt obſerue, that <hi>Gods loue</hi> in this <hi>verſe,</hi> is called <hi>the loue of Chriſt,</hi> in the <hi>35. verſe,</hi> ſhewing, that God not onely loues vs in Chriſt, but that Chriſt loues vs too: We muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it thus; God loues his Sonne Chriſt Ieſus, and in him all true beleeuers; Chriſt Ieſus loues God the Father, and in him he loues all true beleeuers; and this is the right ſtraine of Gods loue to vs in Chriſt Ieſus. So much for explication.</p>
               <p>For proofe of this point,<note place="margin">Proofes.</note> looke into theſe places of Scripture, <hi>Mat. 3.17. This is my beloued Sonne, &amp;c.</hi> Here is a Proclamation from heauen, publiſhed by Gods owne mouth: God the Father ſpeakes it of his own Sonne, <hi>This is my beloued Sonne,</hi> &amp;c. The words intend two things: Firſt, the loue of God to Chriſt Ieſus, <hi>This is my beloued Sonne,</hi> that is, my moſt dearely beloued Sonne, for ſo it is in the originall: Secondly, the loue of God in his Sonne, to all thoſe that he is well pleaſed withall, <hi>in whom I am well pleaſed</hi>; He doth not ſay, <hi>with whom I am well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi> as my loue ſtaying vpon him only; but <hi>in whom,</hi> as my loue extending it ſelfe to all that are in him. This loue that God beares to Chriſt extends it ſelfe to all men and Angels. All the loue they finde of God,

it is in his beloued Sonne, Chriſt Ieſus, <hi>Iohn 17.23.</hi> and <hi>26. verſes.</hi> In the <hi>23.</hi> our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt loued them, as thou haſt loued me</hi>; ſpeaking of the faithfull: Heere wee ſee that the loue of God to Chriſt, is the ſample or patterne of that loue which he beares to vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now is not the ſampler, or patterne, the ground of that draught which is drawne by it? then the loue of God to Chriſt, muſt needes be the ground of his loue to vs: In the 26. <hi>verſe, That the loue where with thou haſt loued me, may be in them:</hi> With the ſame loue wherewith God hath loued Chriſt, he loues vs; Here he ſpeakes more directly to the point then before, in the <hi>23. verſe,</hi> there was but a likeneſſe, <hi>thou loueſt them, as thou loueſt me:</hi> Here is a ſameneſſe or oneneſſe of each: <hi>The ſame loue wherewith thou haſt loued me, may be in them.</hi> It is not two ſorts of loue, or two ſeuerall loues that God beares to Chriſt, and to vs, but as God is moſt ſimple, and but one, ſo is his loue, the ſame hee beares to Chriſt, the ſame he beares to vs, rooted and groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Chriſt, and in, and through him, extended and communicated to vs, <hi>2 Cor. 5.19. God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world to himſelfe</hi>: Here the Apoſtle ſpeakes of the wonderfull loue of God to the true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing world in Chriſt; and hee comprehends all this loue of God in theſe words, <hi>God reconciled vs to himſelfe in Chriſt</hi>; and withall ſhewes the manner how he hath reconciled vs to himſelfe, <hi>by not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting our ſinnes vnto vs.</hi> Here muſt needes be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite loue and mercy in God, to forgiue ſo many thouſand ſinners, as there are beleeuers, and ſo many thouſand ſinnes as euery beleeuer is guilty of, from
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2715:28"/>
the beginning, to the end of the world: Here is infinite loue; And what is the ground of all this, that the Lord doth vouchſafe all this loue and mercy to beleeuers? why, it is altogether in Chriſt; and this the Apoſtle ſets out moſt ſignificantly in the firſt words, <hi>God was in Chriſt perſonally,</hi> there was the ſeat of his loue; and in Chriſt he loued vs, and in him he reconciled vs to himſelfe, not imputing our ſinnes vnto vs; ſo that all Gods loue which he beares to vs, is in Chriſt Ieſus, <hi>Epheſians 1. verſe 6. To the praiſe of the glory of his grace, wherewith hee hath made vs freely accepted in his beloued</hi>; The Lord is very gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious vnto his children, he takes vs into his fauour, and ſets his loue vpon vs, vouchſafeth many kindneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes vnto vs, and this is a glorious grace, that hee vouchſafeth vs the glory of his grace: God magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies and glorifies his grace exceedingly on vs: In what? In that he doth accept vs, ſaith the Apoſtle; It is a glorious and an admirable grace, that the Lord God being ſo great, ſo holy, and ſo glorious as he is, ſhould yet freely accept vs, ſuch poore, ſinfull, and baſe creatures as wee are; But what is the rule or ground of this, of all this glorious grace? <hi>It is Chriſt Ieſus, it is in his beloued,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, for ſo it followes <hi>in his Beloued, that is in Chriſt Ieſus</hi>: Hee is the beloued Sonne of God; So that wee ſee from proofes out of the Scripture, that the point is cleere, that all the loue, grace and acceptance, that euer God ſhewes to true Bele<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

I will giue you ſome taſte hereof: For to ſpeake of all is infinite and impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Firſt, conſider Chriſt in his relation to God, and ſo he his the Sonne of God, <hi>the onely begotten Sonne of God, Iohn 1.14.</hi> Therefore he is the ſeate of Gods loue: It is ſo betwixt the Earthly Father and his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:2715:29"/>
onely Sonne; but if it ſhould faile in man, yet it cannot faile in God; for Chriſt is called the <hi>Sonne of Gods loue, Col.</hi> 1.13. Therefore hee is the very loue of his Father: Therefore all they that are beloued of God, are beloued in him, or elſe they are not beloued. Secondly, conſider him in relation to vs; He is our head, we his body, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18, and is not the ſenſe and motion of naturall life originally ſeated in the head, and deriued from the head to all the parts of the Body? and ſo it is betwixt Chriſt and vs in the ſenſe and motion of Gods loue, in our ſpirituall life; He is our head, and all our ſpirituall life is in him, and comes from him. <hi>He is the Vine, and we are the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Iohn</hi> 15.5. and what iuyce or nouriſhment ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is in the branches for naturall growth, it is firſt in the ſtocke or roote; ſo it is betwixt Chriſt and vs, what iuyce ſoeuer we haue to grow in Grace, it is from this ſtocke, euen from Chriſt himſelfe. <hi>Hee is the foundation, we the building,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9.11. And doth not the whole frame, waight, and coſt of the building reſt on the foundation? ſo the whole frame of Gods Church, and that grace and worth of euery beleeuing member, it reſts wholly on Chriſt the foundation. Thirdly, conſider Chriſt in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon relation he beares to God and vs, and ſo he is our mediator, and that not onely to God for vs, but from God to vs, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. A mediator generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues of the one party, and conueyes it to the other; and ſo Chriſt receiues the loue of God, and conueyes it to vs: But this may be where the parties are equall; but here God and man muſt be mediated betweene: the parties are very vnequall; and therefore here is a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2715:30"/>
further matter to be preſſed: If the King be diſpleaſed with the ſubiect, he that muſt mediate betwixt them and makes the peace, muſt be ſuch an one as the King loues, &amp; that ſo dearely, as that for his ſake he can be content to forgiue &amp; loue the party that hath offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him; &amp; in this caſe, the loue ſhewed to the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is granted in his loue to the Mediator: So it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God &amp; vs; we haue diſpleaſed him, &amp; therefore Chriſt our Mediator, he muſt be ſo dearely beloued of God, that for his ſake God wil be reconciled to vs; ſo that the ground of all Gods loue to vs is in Chriſt Ieſus. Yea; here is yet a further matter, much more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing this Reaſon; Here is ſuch a mediation, as the like is not found in the world againe; The Mediator is in both the parties betwixt whom he mediates, and both they are in him, that is, God in Chriſt, and Chriſt in God, Chriſt in the faithfull, and the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in him; and therefore there can be no loue of God to vs but it muſt be grounded on Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, in reſpect of his abſolute State in himſelfe; for what ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>All the treaſures of the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and knowledge of God are hid in Chriſt, Col. 2.2.3.</hi> If all Gods Treaſure be in him, then the riches and treaſure of Gods loue is in him too: <hi>In him dwels the fulneſſe of the Godhead bodily, verſe 9.</hi> If the fulneſſe of the Godhead, then the fulneſſe of Gods loue dwels in him, there is the ground, ſeate, and Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it; And therefore the ground of all the loue that God beares to vs, is in Chriſt Ieſus.</p>

Bleſſed be God, who hath bleſſed vs with all ſpirituall bleſsings in Chriſt:</hi> Therefore if we be in Chriſt, wee are happy; whatſoeuer our ſtate be in the world; if we be in afflictions, being in Chriſt, he will helpe vs to beare them; if in temptations, hee will ſtrengthen vs againſt them; if wee be fallen from God by our ſinnes, if wee be in Chriſt, he will raiſe vs vp againe, and renew our peace with God; If wee be in Chriſt, hee will be all in all vnto vs; hee will pacifie Gods wrath for vs, he will procure his fauour, aboliſh ſinne, bring righteouſneſſe, deliuer vs from hell, and bring vs to heauen: Bleſſed men are we if wee can reſt on Chriſt Ieſus, as our al-ſufficient Redeemer and Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>

I doe not ſay, it is in thy power, but yet thou muſt get it, it is thy duty to labour for it, and certainely if the Lord would not aſſiſt thee with his power, and inable thee to beleeue,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2715:32"/>
he would neuer command thee ſo often to beleeue in Chriſt: Not that all men, generally, ſhall or can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, for this is againſt the reuealed will of God, for <hi>all men haue not faith</hi>; but that euery particular man and woman may comfortably and particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude for him and her ſelfe, that certainly God will giue grace and power to beleeue, vpon the vſe of the meanes, for this agrees with Gods reuealed will, the Commandements and promiſes of God being tendred generally to all, and no exception can be found in the word againſt any one in particular. This the Diuell puts into the hearts of men, that when the Miniſter exhorts them to beleeue, and to get Chriſt; they reply, They know not whether they can beleeue or no; or whether they were euer ordained to beleeue or no: and thus the Diuell keepes them at a bay all their life, that they neuer beleeue, nor indeauour to beleeue: But make thou no queſtion whether thou canſt beleeue or no, but vſe the meanes and indeauour to beleeue; for if thou doſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, thou ſhalt ſurely be damned, put it to the tryall, it may be thine endeauours may take effect, and then thou ſhalt ſurely be ſaued. What madneſſe were it in thee, not to put thy ſelfe to the tryall, by vſing the meanes? Many men haue beleeued vpon the vſe of them, and why not thou? But thou wilt ſay, I cannot vſe the meanes at all: thou maiſt at leaſt in outward conformity: But I cannot vſe them as I ſhould: I anſwere, doe it as thou canſt, doe thy beſt; and ſo put thy ſelfe and thine indeauours vpon Gods mercy, and humble thy ſelfe before the Lord for thy weakeneſſe, vntowardneſſe, and hardneſſe to beleeue.</p>

This was infinite loue, that God poured on his head, as the Oyle on the head of <hi>Aron,</hi> that runs downe to the skirts of his cloathing: ſo Gods loue in Chriſt deſcends and runs downe on all the faithfull that now are, or euer ſhall be, to the worlds end. And therefore, firſt let vs conſider of it, and bleſſe God for it, that hath poured out ſuch infinite loue for the vſe and benefit of the Church: Thus the Apoſtle doth, <hi>Epheſ. 1.3.

God that is rich in mercy, through his great loue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hee loued vs, euen when wee were dead by ſinnes, hath quickned vs together in Chriſt, by whoſe grace yee are ſaued</hi>: The Apoſtle would haue vs to reioyce in this, that God ſo loued Chriſt, that in

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>5</label> then this commends vnto vs the wonderfull loue that God beares to his Church in Chriſt Ieſus: Firſt, it is a moſt tender and affectionate loue; Secondly, it is moſt holy; Thirdly, it is moſt perfect; Fourthly, it is vnchangeable; Laſtly, it is moſt comfortable. Firſt, it is a moſt tender loue and affection that God beares to vs in Chriſt; the bowels of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt are marueilous deare, tender, and pretious to God: and therefore the loue that God beares to vs in the tender bowels of his owne bleſſed Sonne muſt needes be marueilous deare, tender, and affectionate, <hi>Zach. 2.8. Hee that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of mine eye:</hi> Why are wee ſo tender to God? Why? becauſe hee tenders vs in the tender bowels of Ieſus Chriſt. Secondly, it is a moſt holy loue, our moſt holy God loues vs in his moſt holy Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>that holy one of God.</hi> God doth not loue vs as many a wicked Father loues his Childe, in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and wanton courſes; no, that is prophane and carnall loue; but hee loues vs with a holy loue in Chriſt, ſo farre as we are waſhed from our ſinnes in the bloud of Chriſt, and as we be made conformable vnto Chriſt, ſo farre as we denie our ſelues, and dye to ſinne, and riſe againe to newneſſe of life. Thou that goeſt on in thy ſinne, neuer dreame that God loues thee in Chriſt, except thou haſt crucified the fleſh with the luſts, they that haue their part of Gods loue in Chriſt, they crucifie the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, then this loue of God to vs in Chriſt, is
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:2715:34"/>
a moſt perfect loue, <hi>Ioh. 17.23.</hi> God loues vs with the ſame loue wherewith he loues Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot but be a moſt perfect loue; If God ſhould loue vs in our ſelues, it would be a very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect loue, not worthy God; becauſe all the louely graces in the beſt of vs are ſtained with many imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; and therefore God takes vs, and ſets vs into Chriſt, forgiues all our ſinnes in his death, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers all our vnrighteouſneſſe with his righteouſneſſe, and ſo beholds vs, and loues vs in him with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect loue; and if we haue not this perſwaſion, we ſhall neuer come to haue any true peace in our conſciences. Fourthly, if God loue vs in Chriſt, then his loue to vs is moſt vnchangeable and vnmoueable; it is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and built on a Rocke, and the Rocke is Chriſt Ieſus, and therefore can neuer be moued, but ſtands faſt for euer: If any thing can alienate Gods loue from Chriſt Ieſus, then it may alienate his loue from vs; If nothing can remoue his loue from Chriſt, then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can remoue it from vs; and let ſinne and Sathan, and all our enemies, bodily and ſpirituall, ſtand vp and ſay what they can doe againſt vs: Can you draw vs from the loue of God? wee will put you hard to it: well, doe your worſt: Can you draw the loue of God from Chriſt? if you cannot, (as wee are ſure you cannot) then you cannot draw it from vs, for it is grounded in Chriſt Ieſus. Laſtly, if God loue vs in Chriſt, then this loue of God to vs is a moſt ſweet and comfortable loue, and that in all the former reſpects, becauſe it is a tender loue, a holy loue, a perfect loue, and an vnchangeable loue; yea, but eſpecially in this reſpect, becauſe it is in Chriſt Ieſus: the very name
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2715:34"/>
of Gods loue is very ſweet and comfortable vnto vs, but when the nature of it is tendred vnto vs in the name and perſon of Ieſus Chriſt, it is much more ſweet and comfortable vnto vs: To be ſorted with Chriſt in any ſtate whatſoeuer, is very comfortable to the beleeuing ſoule, to be in afflictions and reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches with him, yea, to dye with him, this is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable thing to Gods Children; Who would not thinke themſelues happy to be ioyned with Chriſt in any of theſe? Yea, but to be ſorted with Chriſt in the boſome of God, in the loue of God; that God ſhould loue vs in Chriſt Ieſus, yea, and with the ſame loue wherewith hee loued Chriſt Ieſus: Here is the comfort of all comforts, and the fulneſſe of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.</p>
               <p>The laſt Vſe teacheth vs, that as God loues in <label type="milestone">

Or
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:2715:35"/>
dareſt thou loue where thou doſt not ſee him? Seeing God loues where he ſees Chriſt, and loues not where he ſees not Chriſt, learne his example, and frame loue to his loue; Let vs loue the Creatures of God in Chriſt, the Children of God in Chriſt; let vs loue the ordinances of God in Chriſt; let vs loue God himſelfe in Chriſt, and whatſoeuer we doe in the ſeruice of God, let it be done in Chriſt; whatſouer we doe in word or deed, let all be done in the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.

Secondly, the Apoſtle ſhewes the Bond of this Communion, &amp; that is the loue of God. Thirdly, he ſhewes the ground of this Communion, and of the bond of it, and that is Ieſus Chriſt. Fourthly, the Apoſtle declares the neere intereſt that the faithfull haue to Chriſt, by a note of ſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, our Lord.

               </p>
               <p>That there is a very neere and ſpeciall reference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt Ieſus and all the faithfull; whereby hee is interreſſed in them, &amp; they in him; <hi>He is our Lord,</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:2715:36"/>
ſaith the Apoſtle, and conſequently, wee are his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects and ſeruants, for this is a terme of mutuall rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, intending his right in vs, and ours in him; his ſuperiority ouer vs, and our ſubiection vnto him; hee is our Lord, and we are his ſubiects and ſeruants. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our manner, we will ſpeake ſomewhat of this by way of Explication:<note place="margin">Explication.</note> And therein wee are to conſider of two things: Firſt, of the Title, <hi>Lord.</hi> Secondly, how it doth ſute with the preſent purpoſe of the Apoſtle. Firſt of the Title, <hi>Our Lord,</hi> or the <hi>Lord</hi> of the faithfull, or the <hi>Lord</hi> ouer his Church: <hi>Chriſt is our Lord: A Lord,</hi> is a name both of honour, and alſo of authority, and power; therefore when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Chriſt Ieſus our Lord,</hi> we muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that he is the owner, and alſo the guider and ruler of the faithfull, hee gouernes vs by his lawes, and guides vs by his Spirit, and keepes vs in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and imployes vs in his ſeruice: The Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Ieſus Chriſt ouer the Church, or ouer the faithfull, is to be conceiued vnder theſe termes; Firſt, that he is our ſpeciall Lord; ſecondly, that he is our ſpirituall Lord: thirdly, that he is our ſauing Lord; and fourthly, that he is our abſolute and onely Lord. Firſt, Chriſt is our ſpeciall Lord; God the Father, and God the holy Ghoſt, as well as God the Sonne is our Lord; and yet there is but one Lord, as there is but one God, but this is in a generall ſence: But Chriſt is our Lord, not onely in reſpect of the Godhead, as the other perſons are, but in a ſpeciall manner, as hee is our Mediator, <hi>Acts 2.36. God hath made him both Lord and Chriſt:</hi> that is, God hath put this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and honour vpon him, God hath appointed him
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:2715:36"/>
to be our Lord in a ſpecial manner, as he is our Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. Secondly, he is our ſpirituall Lord; he is not the Lord of our bodies onely, but of our ſoules and our conſciences, and this Lordſhip which he hath ouer vs, he exerciſeth not in any worldly ſtate or outward pompe, but in a ſpirituall ſtate, as a heauenly Lord, <hi>Iohn 18.36. My Kingdome is not of this world</hi>; as who ſhould ſay, <hi>I am a King,</hi> but not an earthly King; a Lord, but not a worldly Lord; but I am a ſpirituall <hi>King,</hi> and a heauenly <hi>Lord.</hi> Thirdly hee is our <hi>ſauing Lord,</hi> he is the <hi>Lord</hi> of the whole world; of the wicked, as well as of the faithfull in a generall ſence: but to them he is a deſtroying <hi>Lord,</hi> to vs hee is a <hi>ſauing Lord, 2 Pet. 2.18. Laſt, and grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt</hi>; Chriſt is ſo our Lord, as he is alſo our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; and that not onely with a temporall ſaluation, to ſaue vs temporally, for ſo, as the Prophet ſpeakes, <hi>hee ſaues both man and beaſt</hi>; but as our eternall Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, to giue vs euerlaſting ſaluation both in grace and glory. Fourthly, he is our abſolute and onely Lord, ruling vs meerely by his owne will, freeing vs from all forraigne powers and authority whatſoeuer: If any creature haue any Lordſhip or authority ouer vs, as Kings, Princes, Magiſtrates, Parents, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters haue, it is as ſubordinate to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt; And whatſoeuer they doe to vs, they muſt doe it as vnder him; and whatſoeuer we do to them, we muſt doe it as vnto Chriſt, <hi>Col. 3.23.24. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ye doe, doe it heartily, as vnto the Lord, and not men, knowing that of the Lord ye ſhall receiue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, for yee ſerue the Lord Chriſt:</hi> It is in him, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:2715:37"/>
by him that they rule ouer vs, and it is in him, and for him, that we doe ſeruice to them, for ſo is the rule in that place.</p>
               <p>The ſecond point for Explication is, how this Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſutes here with the preſent purpoſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle: Surely it ſutes very fitly with it, for it is a point very materiall to the cauſe in hand, that is, to proue the ſtability of the faithfull in the ſtate of grace: For ſome happily might obiect and ſay; What if the loue of God be ſet vpon vs in Chriſt, how come wee to fare the better for it? Yes, ſaith the Apoſtle, the ſame Chriſt in whom God loues vs, is himſelfe our Lord, and we are his ſeruants, &amp; therfore his care &amp; reſpect for vs is ſuch, that looke whatſoeuer loue God doth intend and beare to vs in him, himſelfe being our Lord, will faithfully mannage the ſame at all times, for our beſt ſafety and greateſt good: The Apoſtle had named mighty aduerſaries, as <hi>Death, Life, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, &amp;c.</hi> and for our better encouragement againſt them all hee ſets out our Captaine and deliuerer in a high and glorious title: He is a Lord, and therefore farre aboue all our enemies; he is <hi>our Lord,</hi> and therefore can and will deliuer vs from them all.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Proofes.</note>We come to the proofes: There is nothing more frequent in the new Teſtament then this, that Ieſus Chriſt is called our Lord; and no maruell, for this is the very ſumme of the Goſpel, the Apoſtle makes it to be ſo, <hi>Rom. 1.1.3. Paul an Apoſtle of Ieſus Chriſt, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to be an Apoſtle, put a part to preach the Goſpel of God: Concerning his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> I will onely ſerue my ſelfe vpon ſuch places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture where Chriſt is called our Lord in ſome ſpeciall
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:2715:37"/>
ſignificancy, that is, with ſome ſpeciall reference to ſome notable worke, whereby he hath ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be <hi>our Lord. 1 Cor. 8.6. Vnto vs there is but one God, euen that Father, of whom are all things, and we in him, and one Lord Ieſus Chriſt, by whom are all things, and we by him:</hi> Hee had ſhewed before, that there are many Gods, and many Lords, to others; but to vs, that is to the faithful, <hi>there is but one God &amp; Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; one Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Mark how ſignificantly the Apoſtle applies this Title, <hi>Lord,</hi> to <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>Soueraigne Lordly</hi> power he hath ouer all things, eſpecially ouer the faithfull. Chriſt Ieſus hath ſupreame authoritie ouer all things; all things are by him, and we by him; and therefore he is <hi>our Lord,</hi> and our <hi>onely Lord, we haue but one Lord. Rom. 7.25. I thanke God, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> The Apoſtle had complained before of the bitter combate which he felt within himſelfe, betwixt the fleſh and the ſpirit; and finding himſelfe ouer-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with the luſts of the fleſh, in the 24. <hi>verſe,</hi> hee cryes out for helpe, <hi>Oh wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliuer mee!</hi> and preſently he thinkes vpon Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt <hi>our Lord,</hi> and vpon him he ſets downe his reſt, <hi>I thanke God through, Ieſus Chriſt our Lord:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, it is <hi>Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> that hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed me to this combate; It is <hi>Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> that giues me ſtrength in the combate; and it is <hi>Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> that in due time will deliuer me, and giue me victory in this combate; though I be ouermatched with theſe enemies, yet he will ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>match them. Who ſhould a man flie to in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, but to his <hi>Lord?</hi> So the Apoſtle here, flyes to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:2715:38"/>
                  <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> as to his <hi>Lord, 1 Cor. 15.57. Thanks be vnto God, who hath giue vs victory through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt</hi>; The Apoſtle ſpeakes there of Chriſt and of his Reſurrection from the dead, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he hath ouercome death, not for himſelfe onely, but for the faithfull, and in that reſpect he calls him <hi>our Lord:</hi> For wherein did euer Chriſt Ieſus ſhew himſelfe more plainely to be the <hi>Lord,</hi> then by his Reſurrection? And wherein may he <hi>Lord</hi> it more, then in giuing his ſubiects and ſeruants victory ouer Death and Hell, and all their enemies? To proceed yet a little further in the proofe of this point, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this generall proportion of Chriſt being our <hi>Lord,</hi> that is, the <hi>Lord</hi> of all the faithfull; wee ſhall finde that particular beleeuers haue laide parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular claime to Chriſt, euery one of them as to <hi>his Lord, Luke 1.43. And whence commeth it that the mother of my Lord ſhould come vnto me?</hi> A ſtrong faith in a weake woman, to confeſſe <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> to be <hi>her Lord,</hi> euen whileſt he was in his mothers wombe; <hi>My Lord,</hi> that came downe from heauen for me; <hi>My Lord,</hi> that tooke fleſh of the bleſſed Virgine, my neere and deare Kinſwoman, euen for my ſake, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme mee. <hi>Iohn 20.13. They haue taken away my Lord, &amp;c.</hi> She ſpeakes it as a woman weeping and mourning, but not out of a womaniſh paſſion, but out of a ſpirituall and heauenly affection: <hi>My Lord,</hi> that hath forgiuen mee ſo many ſinnes; <hi>My Lord,</hi> that hath caſt out ſeauen Diuels out of me: <hi>My Lord,</hi> that hath ſtood it out manfully on the Croſſe, againſt all the powers of darkneſſe, for the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my poore ſinfull ſoule: <hi>Oh, they haue taken

him away, and I know not where they haue laid him?</hi> If I could tell where they haue laid him, I would ſurely goe to him; I would goe through thicke and thinne, that I might enioy my Lord, but alaſſe, <hi>they haue taken away my Lord. Iohn 20.28. My Lord and my God</hi>; It is the ſpeech of <hi>Thomas,</hi> he ſaw in our Sauiours hands the print of the nailes, whereby he was faſtened on the Croſſe, and in his ſide he ſaw the wound of the Souldiers Speare, and vpon ſight thereof, he cryes out, <hi>my Lord</hi> and my God, as who ſhould ſay, Oh <hi>my Lord,</hi> theſe wounds thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued for my ſinnes and trangreſſions; <hi>Oh my Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reaſons: Firſt, Chriſt is our Lord, becauſe <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> he made vs: Euery free agent is Lord and Maſter of the worke of his owne hands: He made vs, therefore he is our Lord. <hi>Col. 1.16. By him all things were made</hi>; Yea, but ſo he is the Lord of the wicked, hee made them too; yea, but he is our ſpeciall Lord, hee made vs not onely to be Creatures, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the wicked; but to be new Creatures, which is peculiar to the faithfull onely. <hi>2 Cor. 5.17. If any man be in Chriſt, let him be a new Creature.</hi> Hee transformes and new moulds vs, and makes vs new Creatures if we beleeue in him: Our Lord Chriſt, as he makes vs Creatures, ſo he makes vs new Creatures; Chriſt Ieſus hath made vs both Creatures and new Creatures too, and therefore he muſt needes be our abſolute and ſpeciall Lord.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he is our Lord, becauſe we were giuen <label type="milestone">

               <p>The firſt Vſe is concerning Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>He is <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> our Lord:</hi> This is an euident proofe of his Godhead, <hi>he is our Lord,</hi> and therefore our God: Chriſt is ſometime called <hi>the Lord,</hi> and that intends his Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne power and authority ouer all things; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time <hi>our Lord,</hi> and this intends his Soueraigne power and ſupreame authoritie ouer the Church, euery way the name <hi>Lord</hi> proues him to be God: For to haue Soueraigne power, and ſupreame authority ouer all things, or ouer the Church, cannot be giuen to any but to God: Remember the termes before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, vnder which wee are to conceiue Chriſt to be our <hi>Lord,</hi> and euery one of them will neceſſarily conclude that Chriſt our <hi>Lord</hi> is Chriſt our <hi>God:</hi> Firſt, hee is our ſpeciall <hi>Lord,</hi> as hee is our Mediator, and he muſt be God as well as man, that he may be
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2715:40"/>
Mediator betwixt God and man. Againe, hee is our ſpirituall <hi>Lord,</hi> he is <hi>Lord</hi> ouer our ſoules and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and a conſcience well rectified acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth none ouer it but God. Againe, he is our <hi>ſauing Lord,</hi> and none can challenge this but God himſelfe: Saluation belongs to God alone. Laſtly, hee is our abſolute <hi>Lord,</hi> to be obeyed without queſtioning, without controule, and without reſiſting, in all things whatſoeuer he commands: and this none can chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge but God onely. I hope there is none here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that will either deny or doubt of Chriſts God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head: but there are many of vs that in prayer and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference name Chriſt our <hi>Lord,</hi> but yet neuer thinke of his Godhead, which is the life of his Lordſhip, both in himſelfe, and vnto vs: <hi>Chriſt Lord,</hi> without <hi>Chriſt God,</hi> is no <hi>Lord</hi> at all.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> The ſecond Vſe is concerning the wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly vnbeleeuers. If Chriſt be our Lord, that is, the Lord of the faithfull, and of his Church; then the wicked and vnbeleeuers haue nothing to doe with him, that is, as a ſauing Lord: What a deſperate, wretchleſſe, and wofull caſe are they in? Ieſus Chriſt is none of their Lord to ſaue them, nor they are none of his ſeruants, they yeeld him no homage nor obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and therefore can expect no comfort nor ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from him: Conſider both their life and their death: In their life they goe vp and downe doing their owne wils, and not Chriſts will, neither are they ruled by his Lawes, but like Lordleſſe and Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe men, they goe about, ſaying, <hi>What Lord ſhall controule vs?</hi> If they doe ſerue, or be ruled by any Lord at all, it is the Diuell, his word is their Law,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:2715:40"/>
they are ruled by his will, and are at his becke: Let him bid a wicked man ſweare, or lye, or prophane the Sabboth, be drunke, ſteale, &amp;c. ſtraight way he will doe it, he is led by the Diuell, at his will, as the Apoſtle ſaith: Oh, that the faithfull would and could performe ſuch true ſeruice to their Lord Ieſus Chriſt, as theſe doe to their Lord the Diuell! It is a foule ſhame to vs that wee yeeld not ſuch true ſeruice to Chriſt, as they doe to their Lord the Diuell; and it is a foule ſhame in them, that they yeeld ſuch true ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to the Diuell. So at their death, when they are on their death-beds, doe they pray? no, ſaith <hi>Iob, the wicked pray not at all times</hi>; No, they curſe, and rage, and diſpaire, or at the beſt they are like to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball,</hi> their hearts are dead as a ſtone within them, there is no ſpirituall life nor comfort in them; they haue neuer a Lord in heauen to commit their ſoules vnto, but the Lord whom they ſerued in their life, the Diuell ſtands by them ready at their death to carry away their ſoules to hell, when they part from their bodies, as he did the rich mans, and then this curſed Lord and Maſter that ſet them on worke, and to whom they haue done ſuch true ſeruice here, ſhall truely pay them their full wages in euerlaſting tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: They haue ſinned with the Diuell and his Angels here, and therefore it is iuſt with God to giue them their part and portion, and to damne them with the Diuell and his Angels for euer: And then this our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, whom they neglected and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in their life, and would not acknowledge to be their Lord, hee ſhall ſhew himſelfe to be a mighty Lord againſt them, and then hee ſhall exerciſe his
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:2715:41"/>
Lordly power and authority ouer them in wrath and vengeance, to their eternall condemnation. And then the very thought of the Lord Ieſus ſhall be as terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them, as the torment they endure, to thinke that Chriſt ſhould come downe from heauen to ſaue them, and that they ſhould be ſuch wretches, to ſerue the Diuell rather then him.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> The third Vſe is for the faithfull; this toucheth them in many reſpects. Firſt, here is the honour of the faithfull, in that they ſerue this great Lord; Chriſt Ieſus is their Lord, and they his Seruants: When ſundry Ambaſſadors meete together from ſundry places, in a ſtrange Country, he that ſerues the greateſt Prince amongſt them, hath the precedency of place and honour before the reſt, becauſe hee ſerues the greateſt Lord: We all liue here as Seruants to Kings, or Nobles, or Magiſtrates, or Maſters; but the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, howſoeuer they ſerue other Lords, yet their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Lord, is the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and by how much he is greater then other Lords, ſo much the more is their honour aboue all other Seruants what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer: It was that which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Apoſtles boaſted of, and ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted themſelues in, as we may ſee in their Epiſtles, that they were Seruants to this Lord: <hi>Paul</hi> a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant</hi> of Ieſus Chriſt: <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>Seruant</hi> of Ieſus Chriſt, and ſo others. A man when hee ſends an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, graceth himſelfe with the greateſt title he can; the Apoſtles grace themſelues in their Epiſtles with this Title, the <hi>Seruants of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> as the greateſt title they can haue; Nay, the very Angels in heauen take delight and comfort in it, <hi>Reuel. 22.9.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:2715:41"/>
I am thy fellow ſeruant,</hi> (ſaith the Angell to <hi>Iohn) the ſeruant of the Lord Chriſt as well as thou.</hi> Some thinke it a ſhame to be counted Chriſts Seruants; What? ſhall we be aſhamed of that which is our greateſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and honour with God? God forbid: In trouble, and in perſecution, let vs acknowledge him to be our Lord, that will giue vs full content both in grace and glory. Let carnall and prophane worldlings reproach vs (as in theſe dayes it is too common) that wee are too preciſe, and that we are zealous for the Lord of hoſts, that we make conſcience of our wayes, and that we keepe our ſelues from the corruptions of the times, and that we will not runne with them into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of riot, this is the ſcandall of the Croſſe in theſe times, that the faithfull will not company and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolize with the wicked in their ſinnes: no, we will not ſerue your ſinnes, wee ſerue the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and if you reproach vs for it, we will weare that reproach as our Crowne: The glory of the wicked is their ſhame; but the ſhame that the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked lay vpon vs, is our greateſt glory; though this be a ſhame with men, yet it is honour with Chriſt, hee will take knowledge of vs as his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this is matter of comfort to Gods Children; and they ſtand in great neede of comfort in theſe vncomfortable times; why this, that Chriſt is our Lord, if we be ſure of that, it will ſupport and cheere vp our hearts in all our diſtreſſes, againſt deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men, when men, when friends, yea, when our Parents forſake vs, our Lord Chriſt wil neuer forſake vs, <hi>Pſal. 27.10. Though my Father and Mother ſhould
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2715:42"/>
forſake me, yet the Lord would gather me vp.</hi> It com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts vs againſt all oppoſitions of men; they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, great, and ſtrong, they rage, and plot, and they band themſelues together againſt the Lord, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Chriſt, but yet here is our comfort, hee that dwelleth in heauen ſhall laugh, our Lord ſhall haue them in deriſion. <hi>Pſal. 2.2.4.</hi> So it may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vs againſt all our wants, Chriſt is our Lord, and therefore wee ſhall want nothing, <hi>Pſal. 28.1. The Lord is my Shepheard, I ſhall not want.</hi> Againe, it may comfort vs againſt weakeneſſe and infirmities, Chriſt is our Lord, and his grace is all-ſufficient for vs, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>2 Cor. 1.9.</hi> Againe, it may comfort vs againſt all dangers preſent, imminent, and future. <hi>Chriſt is our Lord, therefore we will not feare, The Lord of hoſts is with vs, the God of Iacob is our refuge, Pſal. 46.1.2.3.</hi> So it may comfort vs againſt all Sathans temptations, the fierceſt, greateſt, and fearefulleſt that Sathan can aſſault vs withall. Chriſt is our Lord and Maſter, and can a Lord or Maſter ſee a faithfull Seruant of his wronged and oppreſſed by his enemy, and not ſtretch forth his hand to helpe and reſcue him? If men will, yet our Lord Chriſt will not, nor cannot, but the more fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wee are aſſaulted by our enemies, the more ready will hee be to helpe vs. Therefore in the depth of temptation retire thy ſelfe to this ſure Hold, to Chriſt, as to thy Lord, and ſay vnto him, Oh my Lord, ſeeſt thou how I am oppreſſed with thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and my enemy? Wilt thou ſee me trodden vnder feete? Vp Lord I pray thee, fight for me, ſuffer not my ſoule to be a prey to ſuch a curſed enemy. And
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:2715:42"/>
ſurely if thou doeſt thus, the <hi>Lord</hi> will be very ready to heare thee; <hi>&amp; the God of peace will tread Satan vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy feet ſhortly.</hi> Laſtly, it may comfort vs againſt death it ſelfe: whoſoeuer thou art that haſt ſerued the <hi>Lord Chriſt</hi> in truth in thy life, thou maiſt boldly put thy ſelfe vpon him, as thy <hi>Lord</hi> at thy death; hee whom thou haſt ſerued all thy life, will ſurely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thee at thy death, and in death, and after death: therefore be not diſcouraged at death, it is terrible and fearefull to Nature, but let vs arme our ſelues for it before hand: let vs before hand goe to Chriſt, and let him be our <hi>Lord,</hi> and then we may ſay to our ſoules at our death; <hi>Oh my ſoule,</hi> thou haſt ſerued the <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt</hi> thus many yeares, be not now afraid to goe to thy <hi>Lord</hi> and maſter home to his owne houſe: and we may turne to the <hi>Lord</hi> and ſay, <hi>Oh my Lord,</hi> thou haſt beene my protector ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares, now <hi>Lord</hi> helpe me, for now I ſtand in more neede of thy helpe then euer I did before: <hi>Lord</hi> receiue my ſoule now into thy mercifull hands; and if thou doeſt thus, aſſure thy ſelfe thou ſhalt not be more ready to commend thy ſoule to him, then he will be ready to receiue it into his hands.</p>
               <p>The third Vſe is for matter of dutie, teaching vs <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> that ſeeing Chriſt is our <hi>Lord,</hi> we muſt cary our ſelues to him, as to our <hi>Lord,</hi> in all dutie, as good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruants; he that doth ſo, is the right ſeruant of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> the true and ſound Chriſtian. The du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we are to performe to him are many, we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to theſe two heads: <hi>Doing,</hi> and <hi>Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</hi> In both theſe we muſt conforme our ſelues to Chriſt as to our <hi>Lord.</hi> In <hi>doing</hi>; Firſt, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> bee
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2715:43"/>
our <hi>Lord,</hi> we muſt beleeue in him, truſt in him, and reſt vpon him. <hi>Iſa. 26.4. Truſt in the Lord for euer, for in the Lord God is ſtrength for euermore:</hi> and therfore let vs be confident in him, &amp; rowle our ſelues vpon him, and know whom it is that wee haue tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and hazzarded our ſoule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vpon him. Let vs truſt in the <hi>Lord,</hi> when we ſee nothing in the world but deſolation; he is a <hi>Lord,</hi> and therefore can doe for vs what he will; and he is our <hi>Lord,</hi> and therefore he will doe for vs what he can: And if he can do for vs what he will, by his abſolute power, and will doe for vs what he can of his meere grace and goodneſſe, why ſhould wee not beleeue in him, and reſt vpon him both in life and death?</p>
               <p>Secondly, if he be our <hi>Lord,</hi> then wee muſt reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence him as our <hi>Lord. Mal. 1.6. If I be a Lord, where is my feare. Pſal. 2.11.12. Serue the Lord in feare, and reioyce in him with trembling. Kiſſe the Sonne, &amp;c.</hi> Let vs therefore reuerence him in his Nature, Perſon, Word, Ordinances, in our hearts, liues, and all our courſes: Let this feare be alwayes before our eyes, that wee may neuer ſinne againſt him. It is a fault to be taxed in many Chriſtians, that they come to the Word, and to the Sacraments, with little reuerence to God, none at all to man: God will be honoured with an orderly zeale.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if Chriſt be our <hi>Lord,</hi> then wee muſt loue him as our <hi>Lord. Deut. 6.5. Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoule.</hi> Our loue muſt be ſuch to him, as his loue was to vs, that is, not colde or little, but maruellous great; ſo that he ſhed his bloud for vs. Hath our <hi>Lord</hi> loued
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:2715:43"/>
vs thus dearely, to lay downe his life for vs, then let vs loue him as dearely, let vs lay downe our liues, if we be called to it, for him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if Chriſt be our <hi>Lord,</hi> we muſt imitate him, <hi>Iohn 13.13.14. Yee call me Lord and Maſter, and yee ſay well, for ſo I am; if I then your Lord and maſter haue waſhed your feete, yee ought alſo to waſh one anothers feete:</hi> and verſe 15. <hi>For I haue giuen you an enſample, &amp;c.</hi> Thus we ſhould imitate Chriſt in loue and humilitie, and other graces: wee are much wanting in theſe Duties now in theſe dayes, but if Chriſt be our <hi>Lord,</hi> wee muſt ſhew our loue and humility as Chriſt did, thinke ſcorne of nothing that is to be done for the Children of God: Euery ſeruant will follow his <hi>Lord,</hi> if it be but in an ill faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; then let vs imitate Chriſt in his <hi>graces,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our ſelues to his faſhions.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, if Chriſt be our <hi>Lord,</hi> wee muſt ſerue and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him as our <hi>Lord,</hi> wee muſt doe what hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and nothing elſe, and we muſt doe it, as hee commands it to be done, and we muſt leaue vndone that he forbids: We muſt not be ſeruants to men, (wee muſt ſerue other Lords as vnder our <hi>Lord Chriſt,</hi> and in his name) much leſſe muſt wee ſerue our owne luſts, or the world. Chriſt is our <hi>Lord,</hi> and wee will ſerue him, and not the world, nor our owne ſinfull luſts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in our ſufferings we muſt conforme our ſelues to Chriſt: Let vs know for certaine that wee muſt looke for affliction. <hi>The ſeruant is not aboue his maſter, Matth. 10.24.</hi> It is the niceneſſe of many Chriſtians, that their finger muſt not ake, they muſt
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:2715:44"/>
not endure one temptation, they would fain flie from afflictions, but we muſt looke for them: Did Chriſt goe from the Croſſe to heauen, and ſhall not wee goe the ſame way? we muſt take vp our Croſſe and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him. Secondly, as we muſt looke for them, ſo we muſt carry our ſelues with patience as he did in them, who when he was reuiled, reuiled not againe, when he ſuffered, he threatned not, &amp;c. <hi>1 Pet. 2.23. Leauing vs an example</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that wee ſhould follow his ſteps, verſe 21.</hi> And therefore let vs labour to be patient in the leaſt affliction, for hee is thy <hi>Lord</hi> that puts thee to it. And let them be our owne afflictions, and then we ſhall the better beare greater afflictions, &amp; Chriſts afflictions. Chriſt ware a Crowne of thornes, and was ſtroke vpon that Crowne, to adde affliction to his afflictions; ſo we muſt looke for many thornes, many afflictions, and for affliction to be added to affliction: But yet be of good cheere, Chriſt will recompence all with a Crowne of Glory. Let vs apply this to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: We come heere to the Lords Table, this is a great honour to vs, therefore let vs be thankefull for it: Secondly, let it comfort vs, that if we come in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, we ſhall haue our comfort ſealed vp vnto vs, to our hands, to our mouthes, and to our hearts. Againe, we profeſſe Chriſt to be our <hi>Lord,</hi> then let vs examine whether we feare him, loue him, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him as our <hi>Lord.</hi> Alaſſe, wee muſt all confeſſe we come ſhort in theſe duties; let vs acknowledge this vnto him, and let vs ſay, <hi>Lord</hi> though we deſerue not to be thy ſeruants, yet thou art our <hi>Lord,</hi> and let vs come with more faith and feare, and loue, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2715:44"/>
with more reſolution, to obey him better then euer we haue done. If this Sacrament Seale vnto vs that Chriſt is our <hi>Lord</hi>; it muſt alſo ſeale vnto vs that we are his ſeruants, and then we muſt not honor him for an houre, while we are here, but all our life time. If thou be the ſeruant of Chriſt, he is thy <hi>Lord,</hi> but if thou ſerue the world, or thy belly, or thy pleaſure, or any thing elſe, and not the <hi>Lord Ieſus</hi> in the truth of thine heart, then he is none of thy <hi>Lord, nor</hi> thou art <hi>none</hi> of his ſeruant. And therefore when thou ſhalt come and knocke, &amp; ſay, <hi>Lord, Lord, open vnto me,</hi> he will anſwere thee, <hi>away from me, thou art none of my ſeruant</hi>: therefore let vs ſubiect our ſelues vnto him, in all obedience, both in doing, and ſuffering, as vnto our <hi>Lord,</hi> and ſo he will recompence vs with grace here, and with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hereafter.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N handling this Scripture as GOD in mercy hath giuen ſtrength wee haue proceeded thus farre: Firſt, wee haue ſhewed the dependance of the verſes with the former; then we ſhewed the meaning of the words in themſelues: After that we caſt this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for our better inſtruction and memory, into this mould, and ſhewed that it did empty it ſelfe into theſe ſeauen particulars. Firſt, that which is imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, namely, that there is a Communion betwixt God and the faithfull: Secondly, that which is expreſt, namely, the bond of this Communion, and that is the loue of God: Thirdly, the Apoſtle ſhewes the ground of this Communion, and of this bond too, and that is Ieſus Chriſt: Fourthly, hee ſhewes that the faithfull haue a neere intereſt in Chriſt Ieſus, and this he ſets forth by a terme of neere Relation, <hi>our Lord</hi>: Thus farre we haue proceeded already. The fifth point is, that the Apoſtle auoucheth the ſafety of all the faithfull in the middeſt of all dangers that they are ſubiect to; <hi>nothing ſhall ſeperate vs from the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2715:45"/>
loue of God.</hi> And this he inlargeth in many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, as by and by we ſhall ſee.</p>
               <p>This is the fifth thing then that we are to conſider of, namely the ſafty of the State of Gods children in the midſt of all dangers; wee will propound the the Doctrine thus:</p>
               <p>The hould that the faithfull haue in the loue of God through Ieſus Chriſt, it is a ſure hould:<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> the eſtate of grace that they are in, is an vndefeaſable eſtate, nothing can void them, nothing can depriue them of it. Conſider well the words of the obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; the very words whereof are in effect the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words of this Scripture; and the whole matter of the obſeruation, is the whole matter of this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; For that which we haue ſpoken heretofore tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching our Communion with God, the bond of it Gods loue, the ground of both Ieſus Chriſt, &amp;c. haue beene but preparations to this Truth; and theſe points which follow touching the Apoſtle his certainty he hath, and the vſe he makes of it, are but inferences from this truth. This is the truth it ſelfe, that is here peremptorily and preciſely affirmed: that nothing ſhall ſeperate the faithfull from the loue of God to them in Ieſus Chriſt, nor from the eſtate of grace that they are in: And this the Apoſtle contents not himſelfe onely to affirme in the generall, but withall confirmes it in particular, by a ſufficient rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning vp of all the parts of the Aduerſarie power, that is or can be againſt vs: Death ſhall not, nor life ſhall not, nor Angels, &amp;c. nor any other creature, <hi>nothing ſhall ſeperate vs</hi>; not any one of theſe dangers aſunder; no, nor all of them ioyned
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:2715:46"/>
together, no nor any other added to them, nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creature, put what you will to them, <hi>nothing ſhall ſeperate vs from the loue of God, which is in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> and to put the matter out of all ſhew of doubt, he ſaith, not onely they <hi>ſhall not ſeperate vs,</hi> but he puts it vpon an impoſſib<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lity, <hi>they ſhall not be able to ſeperate vs</hi>; let them ioyne all their powers together, and doe what they can, they ſhall neuer be able to doe it: Thus we ſee the Doctrine is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſed, and the Apoſtle preſſeth it as the maine matter of the Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Explication.</note>I will ſpeake ſomewhat, as our order is, for Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Doctrine, and therein I will handle but this one point: Becauſe the Doctrine ſpeakes of the loue of God, and of the ſtate of grace; we muſt know what it is to be in that ſtate of the loue of God, and the eſtate of grace; for either it hath been our ſtate, or now is, or hereafter ſhall be our eſtate, elſe we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be ſaued: therefore before we ſhew that wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fall away from this ſtate, it is needfull to ſhew what it is to be in it. The eſtate of the loue of God, and the ſtate of grace, is to be throughly reconciled to God, through the precious bloud of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi>; whereby we are iuſtified from all our ſinnes, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a courſe of true ſanctification: It is called the eſtate of Gods loue, in oppoſition to the eſtate of Gods wrath, wherein we are all by nature, <hi>Epheſ. 2.3.</hi> In this ſtate of wrath God lookes downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vpon vs in mercy, and receiues vs freely into his loue through Ieſus Chriſt, and ſo wee are tranſlated out of the eſtate of Gods wrath, into the eſtate of his loue; It is called the eſtate of grace, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2715:46"/>
to the ſtate of ſinne, that we are all in, <hi>Rom. 3.28. All haue ſinned, &amp;c.</hi> In this ſinfull ſtate the Lord lookes downe from Heauen in mercy vpon vs, and in Ieſus Chriſt beſtowes vpon vs the ſauing grace of Iuſtification, forgiuing vs all our ſinnes; and the grace of Sanctification making vs new creatures, and ſo tranſlates vs out of the ſtate of ſinne into the ſtate of grace: Theſe things wee muſt feele in our ſelues in ſome meaſure; elſe wee were neuer in the ſtate of grace. To open the point more fully and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly; the eſtate of the loue of God, and the eſtate of grace, conſiſts in certaine mutuall paſſages betwixt God and man: On Gods part to man, there are two chiefe paſſages, Gods loue, &amp; the perſwaſion of Gods loue: and on mans part, there are alſo two chiefe paſſages; Faith, and Loue: All thoſe that God will ſaue, he loues them from all eternity in Ieſus Chriſt; there is Gods loue, and in due time he acquaints them with it, and perſwades them by his Spirit to beleeue it, and to accept of it, and to returne loue and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for it: there is his perſwaſion. On mans part, man being ouercome with the ſence of this loue, and the force of his perſwaſion, he yeelds to God, and imbraceth this loue, and beleeues the promiſe of grace, and applies it to himſelfe; here is our faith: and withall is carryed after that good God, with the whole bent of his Nature, and ſtreame of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that ſo dearely loued vs; here is our loue. Take it thus, thoſe whom God in mercy doth purpoſe to ſaue, he will come vnto; commonly vpon the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Word, or elſe in ſome ſpeciall affliction, at the leaſt in ſome good imployment, and takes vs
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:2715:47"/>
aſide, and drawes vs into ſome ſerious meditation of our eſtate, and he breakes with vs to this effect: as if he ſhould ſay, Ah poore ſinfull ſoule, thou art in a miſerable, a fearefull, and a damnable caſe, led away euery day into ſinne in a fearefull manner, and euery houre of the day thou haſt deſerued my wrath and fearefull curſe to fall vpon thee, if thou go on in theſe ſinfull courſes, hell and damnation is thy portion for euer; but I haue pitty vpon thee, and would haue thee to haue pitty vpon thy ſelfe; I doe not deſire thy death, but that thou doe repent and liue; and out of my infinite loue to mankinde, I haue giuen my owne deare Sonne <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> to die for ſuch poore wretched ſinners as thou art: and now I come to tell thee, and doe tell thee by my Spirit, that thou poore ſinfull ſoule, art one of theſe ſinners that CHRIST hath purchaſed by his moſt pretious bloud: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Sonne hearken vnto my voyce; <hi>Oh my Sonne giue me thy heart,</hi> turne thy loue and thy affections wholly vpon me, beleeue thou in me, and beleeue in my Sonne Chriſt Ieſus, beleeue his Spirit, his truth, his promiſes; caſt away all thy ſinnes, neuer let them enter into thy heart againe, and giue thy ſelfe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and performe a holy life, be perſwaded by my aduiſe, hold faſt by me, and I will hold faſt by thee; doe thus and I will be thy Father, and thou ſhalt be my childe for euer: Thus God wooes, and thus hee winnes euery ſinfull ſoule: And this perſwaſion of his is not only a bare tender of grace, as if God ſhould ſay, thou ſhalt be ſaued if thou wilt: but it is Gods operatiue work of grace; which he perſwades vs and makes vs able &amp; willing to do; he bids vs beleeue and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:2715:47"/>
withall he giues vs his Spirit, and cauſeth vs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in Chriſt; he perſwades vs to ſet our loue vpon him, and withall hee ſheds forth his loue into our hearts by his holy Spirit, and makes vs able and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to loue him. This is the right ſtate of ſauing grace, or of the loue of God, and when this knot of grace is knit betwixt God and the beleeuing Soule, it can neuer be diſſolued by all the powers of hell. So we ſee the Doctrine explained, that the hould which the faithfull haue in the loue of God through Ieſus Chriſt it is a ſure hould; the eſtate of grace that they are in, is an vndefeaſible eſtate, nothing can voide them, nothing can depriue them of it.</p>
               <p>The proofes of this Doctrine are theſe,<note place="margin">Proofes.</note> 
                  <hi>Pſal. 125.1. They that truſt in the Lord ſhall be as mount Sion, that cannot be remoued, but remaineth for euer</hi>: The perſons there ſpoken of are the ſame that we ſpake of in the Doctrine; <hi>they that truſt in the Lord,</hi> the faithfull ſay wee, that by faith and confidence haue gotten ſure hould of God in Chriſt; ſecondly, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate there ſpoken of, is the ſame we ſpeake of; a ſure and firme eſtate, by way of compariſon, is ſet downe to be <hi>as mount Sion,</hi> the ſurety whereof is ſet downe by negation, <hi>it cannot be moued,</hi> and by affirmation, <hi>but remaineth for euer</hi>: The ſubſtance of the ſpeech is this, mount <hi>Sion</hi> is ſo firmely ſetled as it can neuer be remoued; But all they that truſt in the Lord are in ſuch a ſtate, therefore all they can neuer be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but ſtand faſt for euer. Some obiect and ſay, it is true that the faithfull, ſo long as they truſt in the Lord, are vnmoueable; but they may ceaſe to truſt in the Lord, and ſo may be remoued. I anſwere, this
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2715:48"/>
is a meere illuſion of the place, and this Scripture cannot be ſo deluded; for if they that truſt in the Lord may ceaſe quite from truſting in him, then they may looſe their hold in him, but the place ſaith, they can neuer looſe their hold in God, for then <hi>Mount Sion</hi> may be remoued; but ſaith the Text, <hi>Mount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> can neuer be remoued, therefore they can neuer quite ceaſe to truſt in God: the Prophet concludes as well the ſureneſſe of their truſt, <hi>that it ſhall neuer faile,</hi> as the ſureneſſe of <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> that it ſhould neuer faile: he affirmes as well the ſureneſſe of their faith, as the firmeneſſe of the hold they haue in God. <hi>Matth. 7.24.25. whoſoeuer heareth of mee theſe words, and doth the ſame, I will liken him to a wiſe man that builded his houſe vpon a Rocke:</hi> This wiſe builder is euery true beleeuer, and the houſe there built, is the Reſt that he ſets himſelfe vpon, how hee lookes to be ſaued, the grounding of this houſe vpon a Rocke, is the relying of the Beleeuer, truely and wholly vpon Chriſt Ieſus by a true and liuely faith in his bloud; <hi>the raine fell, and the flouds came, and the windes blew, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe are his tryals by afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, temptations, perſecutions, &amp;c. The beſt belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is ſure to haue tryals enough, euen to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, as much as he can ſtand vnder, and not more; but here is his comfort, his houſe ſhall neuer fall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is built vpon a Rocke: the true beleeuer hath gotten ſure hold on God by faith in Chriſt, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can neuer fall, <hi>Ioh. 3.36. He that beleeues in the Sonne, hath euerlaſting life, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe are the words of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> and are confirmed by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, and that by tearmes of aſſeueration, <hi>Ioh, 6.47.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:2715:48"/>
Verily, verily, I ſay to you, hee that beleeueth in mee hath euerlaſting life:</hi> Here is a true Beleeuer, and what is his portion? <hi>euerlaſting life,</hi> and he ſaith not, <hi>he ſhall haue,</hi> but he <hi>hath it,</hi> hee is ſure of it, hee is poſſeſſed of it: but a man may looſe that which hee hath: yea, but this is eternall life, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be loſt, for if it could be loſt it were not euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting. This appeares further by the nature of the phraſe, <hi>to haue life</hi>; which is not to haue riches, or goods, or poſſeſſions, but to <hi>haue life</hi> is to liue that life which a man hath, as hee that hath naturall life, liues that life, and he that hath ſpirituall life, liues a ſpirituall life; and ſo hee that hath eternall life, liues eternally; ſo that his meaning is, that true beleeuers begin now to liue that life, that they ſhall liue for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, begun here in grace, and continued for euer hereafter in glory; if they that thus beleeue could fall away quite from God, then they muſt dye for euer, and it is not poſſible both to liue and to dye for euer; therefore it is impoſſible that euer any ſuch ſhould fall quite away from God. <hi>Iohn 10.27.28.29. My ſheepe here my voice, and I know them, and they follow mee; and I giue vnto them eternall life, and they ſhall neuer periſh, neither ſhall any plucke them out of my hand</hi>: Here our Sauiour ſpeakes of his Sheepe, not onely of Profeſſours but of true Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers: Sheepe that haue true hearted ſoules to Chriſt their Shepheard, for ſo they are deſcribed, <hi>they heare his voice and follow him</hi>; they deale thus with him; But how deales he with them? <hi>Hee giues them eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life,</hi> and if Chriſt giue it, who ſhall take it away from them? And he ſaith not <hi>I will, but I doe giue
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:2715:49"/>
it them</hi>: euery true Beleeuer at the firſt Act of his conuerſion hath eternall life; he beginneth then to liue eternally, and he ſhall neuer periſh; He may be hunted by Dogges, and Wolues, and Beares, and Diuels, but they ſhall neuer periſh, <hi>neither ſhall any pull them out of my hands</hi>; He that ſeperates vs from God muſt tugge with Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe, and be too hard for him too, elſe they can neuer plucke vs out of his hand: And is not this enough? If it be not, then looke what he ſaith in the 29. Verſe, <hi>My Father, which gaue them me, is greater then all, and none is able to take them out of my fathers hands:</hi> If any ſhould queſtion my power, yet none will que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion my Fathers power; if any were able to plucke them out of my hands, yet none, neither men nor Diuels are able to plucke them out of my Fathers hands, <hi>he is greater then all,</hi> and therefore the ſtate of the faithfull is a ſure ſtate: And marke how our Sauiour in that place changeth his words; in the 28. Verſe he ſaith, <hi>none ſhall plucke them out of his hands</hi>; and in the 29. Verſe, <hi>none can take them out of his Fathers hands,</hi> they neither ſhall nor can: So that the Doctrine is cleere, that the hould that the faithfull haue in the loue of God through Ieſus Chriſt is a ſure hould, and the eſtate of grace that they are in, is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defeaſible eſtate, nothing can voide them, nothing can depriue them of it.</p>
               <p>The reaſons are many; there is no reaſon from man for this, for there is nothing in, nor of our ſelues, but it is contrary and againſt this truth: all the reaſons muſt be fetcht from God. <hi>2 Cor. 1.21. It is God which eſtabliſheth vs with you in Chriſt</hi>; Now looke
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2715:49"/>
vp to God, and all is for this truth, that wee cannot fall; Firſt, his Loue is for vs, and that is euerlaſting: Secondly, his Power is for vs, and that is almighty: Thirdly, his Grace is for vs, and that is all ſufficient: Fourthly, his Will is for vs, and that is vnreſiſtable: Fifthly, his Promiſe is for vs, and that is vnchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: and laſtly, Chriſt his prayer is for vs, and that is vnfallible. A threefold cord is not eaſily broken, but here is a ſixe-fold cord, platted with Gods owne hand, and euery one as ſtrong as God himſelfe, bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vs faſt to the loue of God in Chriſt, and therfore this can neuer be broken.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Gods Loue is for vs, and that is euerlaſting: We <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> muſt be in the loue of God, or elſe this that is here ſpoken concernes vs not; Now his loue is euerlaſting, <hi>Ier. 31.3.</hi> and therefore it cannot be remoued. <hi>Iohn 13.1. Whom he loues once, he loues for euer, euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end he loueth them.</hi> God cannot loue vs to day, and hate vs to morrow, as wee doe, that loue a while and leaue at laſt; farre be it from any of vs, euer to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that God can loue any man as his deare Childe for a fit, and a ſpurt, and yet afterwards hate him, as the Childe of the Diuell, for euer; but this God muſt doe if euer any true Beleeuer ſhould be caſt off, or fall away; but this God cannot doe, becauſe his loue is euerlaſting, and therefore no Childe of God can become a caſt-away.</p>
               <p>Secondly, his Power is for vs, and that is almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  <hi>Iohn 10.29. My Father is greater then all, and none is able to take them out of my Fathers hands.</hi> Gods greatneſſe and his almightineſſe lyes at pawne for it, <hi>1 Pet. 1.5. Wee are kept by the power of God
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2715:50"/>
through faith vnto ſaluation</hi>; the originall ſignifies, that we are kept by the Guard of Gods power, by the ſtrongeſt and ſureſt, and chiefeſt power that God hath; as the Kings Guard is his ſtrongeſt power hee hath about him: And what? is this for a time? no, for euer to ſaluation, ſaith the Apoſtle, to the full accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of our ſaluation.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Gods grace is for vs; and that is all-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, <hi>2 Cor. 12.9. My grace is ſufficient for thee, &amp;c.</hi> which is an effectuall ſufficiency, elſe it could haue beene no comfort to <hi>Paul</hi>; for <hi>Paul</hi> was then in great diſtreſſe, the meſſengers of Sathan, theſe <hi>Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> here ſpoken of, were about his eares buffetting him, he findes no power in himſelfe to withſtand, and therefore he beſought the Lord for this; and God giues him this anſwere to ſatisfie and to pacifie him withall, <hi>my grace is ſufficient for thee</hi>: though thou haſt no power nor grace to ſtand againſt this fiery temptation, yet be of good comfort, my grace is, and ſhall be, ſufficient for thee. But you will ſay, this was <hi>Pauls</hi> particular caſe, but what is that to me, or to another? I anſwere, it is true, it was his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular caſe, but yet ſo as it is exemplary, and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all true beleeuers for euer after, ſo ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle himſelfe, <hi>1 Tim. 1.14.16. For this cauſe was I receiued to mercy, that Ieſus Chriſt ſhould firſt ſhew on me all long-ſuffering, vnto the example of them which ſhall in time to come beleeue in him vnto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life</hi>; He receiued mercy, that all the Children of God might lay hold vpon it as hee did, in truth, though not in the ſame meaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, Gods will is for vs, and that is vnreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable:
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2715:50"/>
His will is for vs, <hi>Luke 12.32. Feare not little flocke, it is my Fathers will to giue you a Kingdome</hi>; And if it be his will, who ſhall gaineſay it? <hi>Ioh. 6.39. And this is the Fathers will which hath ſent me, that of all that he hath giuen mee, I ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it vp at the laſt day</hi>; now the will of God is vnreſiſtable, <hi>Rom, 9.19. Who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> And therefore the faithfull cannot fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Gods promiſe is for vs, and that is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> God not onely promiſeth grace but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance in grace, as <hi>Ier. 32.39.40. And I will giue them one heart, I will make an euerlaſting Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them, I will put my feare into their hearts, and they ſhall not depart from me</hi>: Here is a promiſe, not of grace onely, but of perſeuerance in grace; and Gods promiſe is vnchangeable, <hi>2 Cor. 1.20. they are yea, and Amen:</hi> It is impoſſible that God ſhould lye, <hi>Heb. 6.18.</hi> and therefore ſeeing God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that we ſhall ſtand faſt; it is impoſſible that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we ſhould fall away.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Chriſts interceſſion is for vs, and that is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> vnfaillable, <hi>Luke 22.32. I haue praide that thy faith may not faile</hi>; that is, that thou maiſt neuer fall from faith. But this is particular for <hi>Peter</hi>; no, it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall for all as well as he, <hi>Ioh. 17.9.20. I pray for them, I pray not for the world, I pray not for theſe alone, but for them alſo that ſhall beleeue in me through their word</hi>; he prayes for all beleeuers: now Chriſts pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is alwayes heard, <hi>Iohn 11.4. Father, I know that thou heareſt me alwaies:</hi> therefore the faithfull can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fall away.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:2715:51"/>The firſt Vſe of this point is matter of confutation, againſt thoſe that hold that the Saints may vtterly fall from grace; It is held both by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> as alſo by the <hi>Arminians</hi> both at home and abroad; they hold that Saints may vtterly fall away from grace: I will aske theſe men, that are ſo peremptory in this point, this queſtion, whether they can ſhew me any one place in the Book of God, that doth directly and expreſly affirme that a true Beleeuer may vtterly fall away from grace? They cannot, ſome of themſelues confeſſe they cannot; then I anſwere them, that we can ſhew many expreſſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the contrary, directly affirming the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of falling away, and they haue not one for the poſſibility of it, therefore wee may quickly iudge where the truth is. Yea, but ſay they, there is many exhortations to the faithfull for that end, that they ſhould not fall away, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.15. &amp;c. and theſe ſhould be in vaine, except there were ſome poſſibility that they might fall. I anſwere, ſuch exhortations there are, and they are directed to mixt congregations that conſiſted as well of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites that might fall away, as well as of true Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers that might not fall away; and ſo they are not in vaine in reſpect of theſe Hypocrites, neither were they in vaine in reſpect of Gods Children, but of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular vſe in reſpect of them too, for thereby they were ſtirred vp to ſhake off ſecurity, and to be more di<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Demas, &amp;c.</hi> that were true beleeuers, and yet fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. I anſwere, they can ſhew me neuer one exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of any that fell away finally, but ſuch as were hypocrites; I will ſay confidently, that he that fals vtterly away from grace, was neuer but an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite; no true beleeuer can fall away; I dare ſay it becauſe Chriſt hath ſaid it before me, <hi>Math. 7.26.27. The fooliſh man built his houſe vpon the ſands, and when the ſtormes came, it fell.</hi> Doeſt thou ſee a man build him an houſe, and it fall? certainely that man built vpon the ſands, that is, onely vpon the profeſſion of ſauing faith; hee had neuer true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing faith in CHRIST, but his owne fooliſh per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion; the true beleeuer builds vpon the Rocke CHRIST, and therefore his houſe can neuer fall. To eſtabliſh our Iudgements herein, let vs hould faſt theſe two poſitions: Firſt, that hypocrites and counterfeits, may and doe fall away finally, <hi>Matth. 13.21. But true beleeuers can neuer fall finally from GOD:</hi> Both theſe are affirmed, <hi>1 Iohn 2.19. They went out from vs, but they were not of vs, for if they had beene of vs, they would no doubt haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with vs.</hi> Secondly, that true beleeuers may fall from the ſence of GODS loue, and from the exerciſe of Faith and Loue, and obedience, and other graces; from ſome degree of Faith, and from ſome degree of GODS loue, and from the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of grace, as in the caſe of ſpirituall deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, temptation, ſpecially by ſinne, but they can neuer fall from faith, nor from the loue of GOD it ſelfe, nor from the life of grace, or at the leaſt where they doe fall, they neither fall
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:2715:52"/>
wholly nor finally: the whole power that is in them is not carryed after ſinne, but there is ſome reſiſtance: A child of God in the caſe of ſin, hates that he doth, he cannot fall wholly, the ſeede of God is ſtill within him, <hi>1 Iohn 3.19.</hi> and that will reuiue againe; nor he cannot fall finally, becauſe that ſeede is immortall, <hi>1 Pet.</hi> 1.23. and therefore can neuer die. They that are in the ſtate of grace, heare a voyce behind them ſaying, <hi>This is the way, walke in it, Iſa. 30.21.</hi> they haue the guidance of Gods Spirit, whereby they are preſerued from euill, and fitted for euery good dutie, ſo that they cannot fall wholly nor finally. And yet they may haue ſuch falles as are fearefull, and which they may rue for euer, as wee may ſee in <hi>Dauids</hi> fall, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 51. Theſe two poſitions well conſidered are a ſufficient preſeruatiue to keepe vs from this errour.</p>

cares not how? It were a wicked childe that would doe thus: a good and true-hearted child to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would neuer doe it. It was the diuels temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to our Sauiour, <hi>Luke 4.9.10. that he ſhould caſt himſelfe downe headlong:</hi> An impudent perſwaſion to the Sonne of God: What is his reaſon whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he perſwades him thus to caſt away himſelfe? forſooth becauſe he had the promiſe of Gods prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for, <hi>they ſhall beare thee in their hands, ſo that thou ſhalt not daſh thy foote againſt a ſtone</hi>; as if he ſhould ſay, thou maiſt doe what thou liſt, thou art ſure to be ſafe. Shall we giue our ſelues ouer to ſinne, to deſperate and wicked courſes, becauſe wee haue Gods promiſe not vtterly to fall from grace? God forbid. This was the Diuels Diuinity, and it is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelliſh practiſe whoſoeuer imitates it, and ſo let vs eſteeme of it and abhorre it in our ſelues and others: Oh beloued we muſt conſider that the ſame grace of God whereby we are ſaued, the ſame grace doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue vs from ſinne, and quickens vs vp to good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. It is the Apoſtles words, <hi>Titus 2.11.12. The ſame grace of God that brings Saluation to vs, makes vs alſo deny all vngodlineſſe, and wordly luſts, and to liue ſoberly, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore whoſoeuer thou art that profeſſeſt thy ſelfe to be a beleeuer, and yet haſt no care nor conſcience to abſtaine from ſinne, and to lead a godly life, it is a ſtrong preſumption againſt thee, that thou neuer yet hadſt any true touch of ſauing grace.

God of the honour of their ſaluation, to aſcribe it to themſelues. And it is an vſuall and iuſt thing with God to recompence ſuch abhominable pride with a ſhamefull fall: <hi>Iohn 18.</hi> It was the ſecret pride of <hi>Peters</hi> heart, and confidence of his owne ſtrength that made him ſay, that though all the world ſhould forſake Chriſt, yet he would not, yea, though he dyed with him, hee would not forſake him; which was iuſtly recompenced with that ſhamefull and fearefull fall, that he was the only man that not only forſooke him, but denyed him, and forſwore him too: that <hi>Peter</hi> might after be warned, and we by his example, neuer to thinke of ſtanding by our owne ſtrength, but wholly and onely on the power of God, who is all in all in it. Let vs waite vpon God in the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of our ſoules, and by faith and confidence put him in truſt with our ſtate; and let vs doe the beſt we can to keepe in the ſtate of grace, but yet let vs giue the whole glory of our preſeruation to God alone.</p>

And therefore we muſt vſe all meanes for the eſtabliſhing of our ſelues in grace, when we are once entred into that eſtate; which ſtate we muſt labour to be ſure that we are in, and not flatter our ſelues; and then we muſt labour to vſe all good meanes to be eſtabliſhed in it: Firſt,<note place="margin">Meanes to bee vſed that we may perſeuere in grace.</note> we muſt lay a ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation or ground, if euer wee will hold out in the eſtate of grace, elſe wee ſhall quickely decay: See that thy ſaith in Chriſt be true and ſound, grounded on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the Word and promiſes of God, and the infallible teſtimonies of Gods Spirit, that cryes, <hi>Abba,</hi> Father, within thee; And let thy repentance be vnfained, not a few teares, but euen the breaking of thy heart; And let thy conuerſion be through, be not halfe a Chriſtian, and ſee all thou doeſt be done in truth, and then thou haſt laid a good and ſure foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Luke 6.48.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:2715:54"/>
ſinne, and a deepe ſighing for grace; and a deepe Impreſſion of the Word in our hearts; we muſt not be hearers and ſpeakers of it, and rememberers of it onely, but it muſt dwell plentifully in vs, it muſt transforme our hearts into the obedience of it; If euer we looke to lay a good foundation in God, wee muſt digge deepe, <hi>Matth. 13.5.6.</hi> The Corne that was ſowen in the ſtony ground, came vp quickely &amp; periſhed quickly, becauſe it had no depth of earth: Our ordinary hearers are quicke and apt to ſpeake of that they heare, but the Word hath no depth of rooting in their hearts, and therefore they quickely fall away: be ſure therefore that thou dig deepe, and that that which thou buildeſt vpon be deepe in thy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> heart. Secondly, that we may hold out in the ſtate of grace, there muſt be a firme reſolution in vs to ſtand faſt whatſoeuer come of it, and for lacke of this, many haue fallen ſhamefully away, In <hi>Act. 11.23. Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> exhorted all, <hi>that with purpoſe of heart they would continue in the Lord</hi>; we muſt be reſolute to deny our ſelues, to leaue our ſinnes, to fight againſt our corruptions, and to endure temptations, and to looſe all, yea, our liues and all, rather then to looſe our hould in God, many there are that make reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to leade a holy life, but either they are paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate or colde, no maruell though ſuch reſolutions neuer hold out: many make reſolutions in a paſſion, and they will neuer hold, <hi>Deut. 5.27.29.

Thirdly, that we may be eſtabliſhed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in grace and perſeuere therein, wee muſt daily rippe vp our hearts and our reines before God, wee muſt diſcouer our ſinnes and corruptions and infirmities, and wants to God, <hi>Pſal. 16.8. I haue ſet the Lord euer before me, becauſe he is at my right hand I ſhall neuer be moued</hi>; The way to keepe vs from falling, is to walke openly and nakedly before the Lord, without diſſembling, reſeruations, circumloquutions; neuer bee either afraid or aſhamed to tell GOD what thou wanteſt, for ſo much as thou faileſt in making thy ſelfe throughly knowne to GOD, ſo much thou euer giueſt thy ſelfe to fall away from grace.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, to preſerue vs from falling from grace, we muſt watch continually ouer our owne hearts that we doe not fall. <hi>Matth. 26.41.</hi> Our Sauiour preſcribes it of purpoſe, as a preſeruation from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: Thy heart is deceitfull aboue all things; watch thy heart therefore at euery turne, leſt it fall away: But alaſſe, what will our watchfulneſſe doe? Yes, it is very effectuall when it is ioyned with prayer; Watch to keepe thy ſelfe, and pray to God to keepe thee, and thou ſhalt be well kept; Bring God vnto thy watch by thy prayer, and then though thou be heauy and ſleepy, yet hee neuer ſlumbers nor ſleepes, he will ſurely keepe thee.</p>

Remember from whence thou art fallen, and repent:</hi> Haſt thou ſinned? oh what haſt thou done? Get thee to God, humble thy ſelfe before him, confeſſe and bewaile thy ſinnes with a broken heart, take hold on the promiſe of grace in Chriſt; renew thy vow, and promiſe to God, and ſee thou performe it, to be more careful for euer after, and this do ſpeedily; It is a great aduantage that ſinne gets of vs, by reſting in vs, like a ſore that is let alone, it feſters, and is harder to be cured.</p>

               <p>Laſtly, let vs be ſure we be alwaies going forward, for ſurely our not going forward, is ſome degree or beginning of going backward, <hi>Phil. 3.13.

               <p>Now we come to ſpeake of the ſixt point, and that is, the confident perſwaſion which the Apoſtle hath concerning this heauenly truth, I am ſure hee is
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:2715:56"/>
ſure of it: Firſt, I will propound the Doctrine; in that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I am perſwaded, or I am ſure, that all the faithfull ſhall continue in the loue of God without ſeperation</hi>; the obſeruation is this:<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> Gods Children, all true Beleeuers, may and ought to haue a confident perſwaſion in themſelues of their owne certainty and continuance in the ſtate of grace and ſaluation: for howſoeuer the perſwaſion here ſpoken of, is a perſonall and a particular perſwaſion of <hi>Paul,</hi> (I am perſwaded) yet the matter which he is peſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of, is generall to all beleeuers, <hi>I am perſwaded</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that nothing ſhall ſeperate vs</hi>: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eſtate of all true beleeuers being in it ſelfe as firme and ſure as <hi>Pauls</hi> was; then their aſſurance muſt be in ſome meaſure anſwerable to his. To ſet the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine right, that we may receiue it in the truth of the Apoſtles intendment, and apply it to our ſelues right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt deſpaire, and yet without preſumption;<note place="margin">Doctrine clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions as ſeeme to lye in the Text.</note> we are firſt to cleare it of ſome exceptions, and then to bound it within certaine bounds or limmits: Firſt, of the exceptions, I doe not meane ſuch exceptions as are made againſt the Doctrine it ſelfe, (for of them we ſhall ſpeake in the vſes,) but of ſuch as are made againſt this Scripture, from whence the Doctrine is raiſed. The firſt exception is this; the word here tranſlated, <hi>I am perſwaded or ſure,</hi> doth not alwaies in Scripture ſignifie ſuch a confident perſwaſion, as we heare ſpeake of; it ſignifies indeed a probable or hopefull opinion, not a confident perſwaſion, as for inſtance, <hi>Rom. 15.14. I my ſelfe am alſo perſwaded of you my Brethren, that ye are full of goodneſſe, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with all knowledge, &amp;c.</hi> Is this a confident per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion?
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:2715:57"/>
The Apoſtle knew not their hearts, and therefore could not be confidently perſwaded of this, it was onely a probable and hopefull opinion (ſay they:) and ſo that in <hi>2 Tim. 1.5. I call to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance the vnfained faith that is in thee, which dwelt firſt in thy Grand-mother Lois, and in thy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eunice, and I am perſwaded that it dwelleth in thee alſo.</hi> To this exception I anſwere, that it is true, that theſe places are to be vnderſtood of a hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or charitable, or probable perſwaſion, and ſo the word may ſometime ſignifie (and yet in theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>Paul</hi> might ſpeake by ſpeciall reuelation, but wee will not ſtand vpon that:) But yet it is as true, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time this word ſignifies a certaine knowledge, and a confident perſwaſion, as <hi>Rom. 14.14. I know, and am perſwaded through the Lord Ieſus, that there is nothing vncleane of it ſelfe, &amp;c.</hi> Here is a confident perſwaſion; and ſo in the 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>For I know whom I haue beleeued, and I am perſwaded that he is able to keepe that which I haue committed vnto him, againſt that day:</hi> Here is a confident perſwaſion, becauſe it is ioyned with certaine knowledge, and therefore the perſwaſion muſt be certaine too; ſo that all this while the matter lyes in ſuſpence, for in ſome places it ſignifies a confident perſwaſion, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers a probable perſwaſion; Which then is here meant? Goe to the Rule: Where one and the ſame word is vſed in diuers ſences, in diuers places of Scripture, the circumſtances of the Text muſt iudge and declare in what ſence it is to be taken in that place: Now looke into the circumſtances of this Text, and we ſhall finde, that it is here to be taken,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:2715:57"/>
and muſt be meant of a confident perſwaſion, for in the 35. Verſe the Apoſtle had confidently inſulted ouer all dangers, <hi>what ſhall ſeperate vs from the loue of God in Chriſt? &amp;c.</hi> And he giues the reaſon of it in this Verſe, <hi>for I am perſwaded, &amp;c.</hi> Why doth he ſleight his enemies ſo? Becauſe hee is ſure nothing ſhall ſeperate him from the loue of God, <hi>For I am ſure.</hi> Doth he ſo confidently inſult ouer all dangers, becauſe hee ſuppoſeth, or hath ſome probable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or ſlender perſwaſion? That were too weake a ground to cauſe him to inſult ouer ſuch ſtrong ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as theſe are; but becauſe he is ſure and certainly perſwaded that they ſhall not hurt him, therefore he may and doth ſafely and confidently inſult ouer them; therefore this a confident perſwaſion. Againe, in the 30. Verſe, he had pronounced himſelfe a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, yea, more then a Conquerour, as if the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory were already gotten: <hi>In all theſe things we are more then Conquerours</hi>; and he giues the reaſon of it in the 38.39. Verſes, <hi>for I am perſwaded, &amp;c.</hi> And doth the Apoſtle pronounce himſelfe a Conquerour before he be ſure of the Conqueſt? that were a proud and a vaine boaſting, which <hi>Paul</hi> was free from: but he doth pronounce himſelfe a Conquerour vpon this perſwaſion here ſpoken of, becauſe hee is ſure, <hi>that neither death, nor life, &amp;c.</hi> can hurt him: therefore the word in this place ſignifies a certaine and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident perſwaſion, ſuch as the Apoſtle dares build his ſoule vpon againſt all commers.

ſo? They that make this exception, will deny this when it comes to the proofe; For, if <hi>Paul</hi> had it by ſpeciall Reuelation, that he nor none of the faithfull ſhall euer fall away from the loue of God, then it is certaine that the ſtate of the faithfull is vnfallible, and that they ſhall neuer fall from it; for ſpeciall Reue<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The ſecond limit is concerning one and the ſame particular Beleeuer, hee muſt not alwaies thinke to haue this confident perſwaſion alike; the ſtrongeſt faith is ſometimes abated to much weakeneſſe: There was a time when <hi>Iob</hi> ſaid, <hi>that though God did kill him, yet would hee truſt in him, Iob 13.15.</hi> And there was a time againe when the ſame <hi>Iob</hi> ſaid, <hi>Oh that I might haue my deſire, that is, that God would deſtroy mee, &amp;c.

               <p>Firſt, the giuing and receiuing of the Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets <label type="milestone">

Hereby, we know that we dwell in him, and he in vs, becauſe he hath giuen vs of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>: Hence it is that this Spirit thus giuen is called <hi>an earneſt, Epheſ. 1.13.14.</hi> It is a ſignificant compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and moſt pregnant to our purpoſe; An earneſt we know is ſomething giuen in hand at the making

vp of a bargaine, the buyer giues it, the ſeller receiues it, and thereby both parties are bound to the full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the bargaine: ſo it is betwixt God and our poore Soules in our conuerſion, God bargaines &amp; couenants with vs to be our God, and to make vs his children, and heires of ſaluation; he giues vs an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and we receiue it; what is that? His Spirit to aſſure vs that as he hath begun, ſo he will go on with vs, and that his Couenant ſhall neuer be broken; and wee receiue it vpon the ſame condition. If but a man giue vs an earneſt, if he be an honeſt man, wee are perſwaded he will go on with his bargaine; much more will God, if he giue vs an earneſt, wee may be confidently perſwaded that he will not breake with vs: If God ſhould giue but a ſmall earneſt, but a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, we would beleeue that he would performe with vs; but he giues vs his owne Spirit, as great an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt as himſelfe (in reuerence be it ſpoken to his great Maieſty) and therefore he will ſurely goe on with vs: he giues vs his Spirit to aſſure vs, that he will not faile vs, and therefore we may confidently be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of it, that he will performe his word to vs; and he giues vs this earneſt nor in our hands, for haply we might looſe it then: but in our hearts, and there it reſts as a Seale, to ſeale vs vp to God for euer and euer, <hi>2 Cor. 1.22.

               <p>Laſtly, faith mixt with feares and doubtings, is but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> a ſmall and a little faith. <hi>Math. 8.26. Why are yee fearefull O yee of little faith?</hi> And ſo in the whole courſe of grace, all the duties of Gods ſeruice will be much dampt in vs, if we goe not along with this full Sayle, this full perſwaſion: Yea, but ſay the Papiſts, where doe you finde in any place in all the Scripture, that it is written that euery particular man by name ſhall be ſaued? Is there any among you named in the Scripture? If it be not written there, how can it be beleeued? I anſwere, we haue as good cauſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, as if our names were ſet downe in Scripture: God hath made his promiſes vpon ſuch and ſuch quallifications; if I then finde theſe in my ſelfe, I may build vpon Gods promiſes, that they are made to me: As if the King ſhould proclaime, that a<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:2715:64"/>
repents, ſhall be ſurely ſaued; then ſay I, I beleeue and repent, in my poore meaſure, therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that I ſhal be ſaued. For the firſt Propoſition, the aduerſaries agree with vs, that whoſoeuer beleeues and repents ſhall be ſaued: but to the ſecond they ſay, how doe you know that you beleeue and repent? I anſwere, faith is an act, and therefore may be known of the beleeuer, as he that ſees, doth know he ſees, and he that heares, doth know he heares, &amp;c. and is not our beliefe a matter of our vnderſtanding, as well as of our will? Therefore euery one that beleeues, knowes that he doth beleeue; it is a very vntoward faith that is without knowledge of it, and he a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeuer, that knowes not whether he beleeues or no. <hi>Math. 9.28. Ieſus asketh the blinde men, beleeue ye that I am able to doe this? and they ſaid vnto him, yea Lord:</hi> and ſo <hi>Ioh. 9.35.38. he asked the blinde man whom he had cured, Doſt thou beleeue in the Sonne of God? Verſe 38. He ſaid, Lord I beleeue:</hi> Euery true beleeuer knowes, and can truely ſay he doth beleeue. Againe, we may know we haue faith, by the proper effects of faith, which is a godly life. Laſtly, we may know it by the Spirit bearing witneſſe to our Spirits, <hi>Rom. 8.16.</hi> And there cannot but be certainty of faith, where there is the ſence of faith by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>

Seauenthly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> let vs obſerue faithfully, the daily experiments of Gods truth on others, ſpecially on thy ſelfe, and that
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:2715:66"/>

So if we haue got ſome perſwaſion of the loue of God, though afterward we looſe the ſenſe of it, yet let vs ſay to our ſoules, ſurely God would neuer haue done all this for me, he would neuer haue ſhewed me the way of Religion, and wrought ſome good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion in mee of his loue towards me, if euer he had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> purpoſed to deſtroy me.

Prooue your ſelues whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are in the faith, &amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtle would haue vs to attaine to this certainty of perſwaſion, and how? why, ſaith he, <hi>proue your ſelues, try your ſelues:</hi> of what? <hi>whether Chriſt be in you:</hi> Whether he liue in you by his grace, and by his Spirit; whether by his death he mortifie your ſinnes, and by his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection quicken you vp to newneſſe of life; if he do, then we may be fully aſſured that we ſhall neuer be caſt off.</p>
               <p>This point we muſt bring our ſelues to, for this will bring comfort to vs in our ſinnes, in our ſickneſſe, in our temptations, in all theſe if we looke to our vnion
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:2715:66"/>
which we haue with Chriſt, we may haue comfort: God hath knit me to himſelfe in Ieſus Chriſt, and therefore I know that all theſe ſtormes ſhall end, and turne to my good. And ſo in the want of any grace, this is our comfort, that we are knit vnto Chriſt, &amp; al-ſufficiency is in him, and of his fulneſſe wee ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue <hi>grace for grace</hi>; therefore let vs labour to bee well acquainted with this grace, <hi>our vnion with Chriſt.</hi> And let vs make good vſe of this word now deliuered vnto vs, wee know not what tryals God hath in ſtore for vs; and therefore let vs labour by all theſe meanes for this confident perſwaſion of Gods loue to vs: God giues vs his Sacrament to aſſure vs of it, and would haue vs be perſwaded that he loues vs, and though we cannot attaine to this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion in that ſtrength that we ſhould, why yet God is not captious, he will take all things at the beſt, walke before him and be vpright, and hee will be our GOD all-ſufficient.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N handling of theſe words, as you may remember, wee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded as God enabled vs in this preſent ſeruice, to reduce the whole Summe of theſe two Verſes, to theſe ſeauen heads: Firſt, that there is a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion betwixt God and the faithfull, ſo the word <hi>ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> doth preſuppoſe: ſecondly, wee ſhewed the Bond of this Communion, the loue of God: thirdly, we ſhewed the ground both of this Communion, &amp; of the Bond of it, and that is Ieſus Chriſt: Fourthly, we ſhewed the neere relation that there is betwixt Chriſt and thoſe that beleeue in him, <hi>He is our Lord,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Fiftly, we ſhewed the certainty of the State of the faithfull in it ſelfe: that neuer any thing ſhould <hi>ſeperate them from the loue of God:</hi> The ſixt point (which we handled the laſt time) was the certainty of it in our owne hearts. The ſeauenth and laſt point which now we are come to, is; That the Apoſtle beares vp himſelfe boldly vpon this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance againſt all dangers and troubles, that euer did or could befall him. And this is the maine reach of the Apoſtles whole diſcourſe; propounded here by
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:2715:67"/>
way of reaſon, <hi>for I am ſure</hi>; As if hee ſhould ſay, I may boldly and ſafely inſult ouer all thoſe dangers mentioned in the 35. Verſe: But why <hi>Paul</hi> art thou ſo bold? <hi>for I am ſure</hi> (ſaith hee) that not onely thoſe dangers there ſpoken of, ſhall euer ſeperate me from the <hi>loue of God</hi>; no, nor greater then they, nor the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of them, nor Abettors, nor Authors of them ſhall euer doe it; <hi>Be it life, be it death, be it An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels or Principalities or Powers, &amp;c.</hi> Not any of all theſe ſhall be euer able to ſeperate me from the <hi>loue of God:</hi> ſo farre off is it, that Tribulations, or Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp;c. ſhall ſeperate me, that none of theſe that are greater ſhall euer do it; This is the iuſt connexion of theſe verſes with the former, and in this conſiſt the full waight and power of the Apoſtles Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Now concerning this ſeauenth and laſt point, here are two things to be conſidered: Firſt, we are here to conſider of the dangers that the children of God are ſubiect vnto: Secondly, of the ſupport and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort they haue againſt theſe dangers; And both theſe we are to conſider of (God willing) firſt in generall, then in particuler.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we will ſpeake of the dangers and that in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall that Gods children are ſubiect to; and then we will come to the ſupport they haue in them. For firſt we muſt know what the dangers are, before wee can know the ſupport and helpe we haue in them; we muſt firſt know the diſeaſe before we can know the remedy: and concerning the dangers in generall, take notice of theſe foure things; Firſt, the variety of them, they are not one but many, of diuers kinds, ſome dangers of life, ſome of death, dangers wrought by
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:2715:68"/>
diuers meanes and inſtruments, ſome by Angels, ſome by Principalities, and Powers: dangers at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers times, ſome preſent, ſome to come, dangers from diuers places, ſome from <hi>the height aboue,</hi> ſome from <hi>the deph beneath</hi>; here is the variety of them, for the Apoſtle ſpeakes not idlely in any of theſe words.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we muſt take notice of the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and fulneſſe of theſe dangers; they are not onely many and diuers, but euen all the dangers that may be, for here is a ſufficient and perfect reckoning vp of all ſorts of dangers to the full; there is not one danger that can euer be named or imagined, but it may fitly be reduced to one of theſe heads that the Apoſtle here names, either <hi>to life, or to death, or to Angels, &amp;c.</hi> And that the Apoſtle may be ſure to comprehend all dangers, hee doth not onely name actuall dangers, ſuch as doe ordinarily befall vs both of life &amp; death, but poſſible dangers, to come as well as preſent, nay ſuch dangers as in our ordinary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, are impoſſible; <hi>from good Angels,</hi> which is hard to be conceiued how that may be.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we are to conſider the croſſenes &amp; thwart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of theſe dangers, propounded here in oppoſition one to another, and alſo in oppoſition each of them to our owne ſtate and mind; the Apoſtle makes our caſe herein to be like vnto <hi>Iudahs, Iſa. 9.21. Manaſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Ephraim, and Ephraim againſt Manaſſes, and both of them againſt Iudah:</hi> So it is with Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in their tryals, here is <hi>Death oppoſed to life, and life oppoſed to death,</hi> and both oppoſite to Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; ſo here is <hi>good Angels oppoſed to bad,</hi> and bad Angels oppoſed to good: <hi>things preſent oppoſed to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:2715:68"/>
things to come; and things to come oppoſed to things preſent; height oppoſed to depth, &amp; depth to height</hi>; &amp; Gods children ſubiect to all theſe: And this is the <hi>ſting</hi> of our Croſſes, that we are thus croſſed, &amp; thwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our affliction, as when we be pinched with pain on the right hand, we turne to the left to find eaſe; &amp; preſently on the left hand we are pinched as much as before on the right, yet ſuch is the preſent portion of Gods children. The 4 &amp; laſt point is, that the Apoſtle propounds theſe dangers to himſelf, &amp; to the faithful, not as feares or ſhadowes, or imaginations, (<hi>I fight not as one that beateth the aire,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle) but as true &amp; reall dangers, ſuch as he doth acknowledge himſelfe &amp; all the faithfull expoſed vnto, &amp; lookes to be encountred firſt or laſt with ſuch things indeede.</p>
               <p>The Doctrine that flowes naturally from this Scripture thus opened is this:<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> That Gods children muſt make their account, and ſet downe their reſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, that they ſhall be aſſaulted here in this world, with all trials, and dangers, and diſtreſſes, that euer poſſibly can befal them. This Doctrine is eaſie enough to be vnderſtood, (for Gods children ſee the truth of it daily in others, and feele it in their owne ſelues) but it is hardly digeſted: It is a hard ſaying, who can beare it? Therefore that we may the better brooke it,<note place="margin">Foure prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for the brooking of afflictions.</note> let vs receiue it vpon theſe preparations. Firſt, wee muſt not think that all theſe dangers ſhall be heaped <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> vpon euery one of Gods children in ſeuerall, but they ſhall be diſtributed and parted amongſt them all in common. All the afflictions of the faithfull are but one cup, and that Chriſt cals his Cup, <hi>Matth. 20.23. Yee ſhall drinke indeed of my Cuppe</hi>; It is
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:2715:69"/>
Chriſts Cup, and all the faithfull muſt drinke of it; <hi>Yee ſhall drinke,</hi> ſaith our Sauiour; Euery one muſt haue his ſhare, and ſo amongſt them they muſt drinke it all vp. Now becauſe none of vs knowes whether he ſhall drinke of the top of this Cup, or of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, or of the bottome, till his turne come, therefore euery one of vs muſt Arme himſelfe to drinke of any part of it, euery one is to make account that he is lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to euery affliction.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond preparation is this, we muſt not thinke that theſe afflictions ſhall befall all Gods children alike; No, ſome muſt drinke deeper of it then others; God hath ſome vnderlings amongſt vs, children that are weake in faith, and yong in grace, and they muſt haue a ſmaller meaſure of this Cup, an eaſier portion of theſe tryals: Againe, God hath ſome ſtandards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his children, that are ſtrong in faith, Armour of proofe, throughly ſetled and ſtabliſhed in grace; and they ſhall haue a greater portion of this Cup: Such was <hi>Iob</hi> in his time, and ſuch were <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Ieremy,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> in their times; God raiſeth vp ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe Worthies in euery time, and makes them vndergoe and ouercome a world of afflictions, to ſhame them that are fearefull and faint-hearted, and will not vndergoe any affliction; And to beard all the enemies of God, be they men or Diuels, and to magnifie the Almighty power of a ſtrong God, in a weake man: Our heauenly Father is moſt wiſe and mercifull in meaſuring out his afflictions to vs; the ſtrongeſt ſhall be ſure to haue as many as euer he can beare, (God giues him not his ſtrength in vaine.) And the weakeſt ſhall be ſure to haue no more then
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:2715:69"/>
he can beare; God cannot, nor will not, caſt away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his children by their afflictions, how weake ſoeuer they be.</p>
               <p>The third preparation is, that theſe afflictions that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> doe befall vs, ſhall not be powred vpon vs all at once, leſt they ouerwhelme vs, and carry vs away as a whirlewinde into extaſies and outrages, and deſpaire; but they are tendred vnto vs by little and little, by degrees, now one, and then another, as wee ſhall bee beſt able with comfort to beare them: The Lord when he layes affliction vpon vs, he giues vs certain reſpites and breathing ſpaces betwixt our afflictions; elſe the ſpirit of man would faile before him; and in theſe breathing times we recouer our ſpirits. Wee behold and conſider the mercy and goodneſſe of God, in preſeruing and deliuering vs from our great afflictions, and wee get new hearts and courage to beare freſh aſſaults and afflictions.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we are to receiue this Doctrine vpon this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> preparation; that in all our afflictions, we ſhall haue many comforts and helpes proportionably ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, whereby we ſhall be enabled both to vndergoe them, and to ouercome them, <hi>Pſalme 94.19. In the multitude of my thoughts or ſorrowes in my heart, thy comforts haue reioyced my ſoule.</hi> Wee haue ſorrowes indeed; yea, but we haue comforts as well as ſorrowes; wee haue a multitude of ſorrowes, yea, but we haue a multitude of comforts too: Yea, and theſe ſorrowes and comforts are ſo graciouſly tempered by the mercifull hand of God, that euen in the multitude of our ſorrowes, <hi>thy mercies, oh Lord, haue reioyced our ſoules.</hi> And in the <hi>1 Cor. 10.13.</hi> The
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:2715:70"/>
Apoſtle ſaith that God is faithfull, and will not ſuffer vs <hi>to be tempted aboue our power, but will giue an iſſue with the temptation.</hi> There are two things which God promiſeth to all his children in all their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Firſt, a faire tryall, and then a good iſſue; What can we deſire any more? Yes; wee ſhall haue more, we ſhall haue increaſe of righteouſneſſe and grace by them, <hi>Hebr. 12.11. It bringeth forth the quiet fruite of righteouſneſſe</hi>; Would we haue any more? yee ſhall haue more, ſaith God; As they bring you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of <hi>grace,</hi> ſo they doe of <hi>glory</hi> hereafter, they ſhall be recompenced with euerlaſting <hi>glory, 2 Cor. 4.17. Our light afflictions, which are but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cauſeth vnto vs a farre more excellent and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall waight of glory.</hi> By theſe preparations I hope, ye are well prepared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not only to heare and to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, but alſo to brooke and digeſt this Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Now we come to the proofes; <hi>Mat. 16.24. If any man will follow me, let him forſake himſelfe, and take vp his croſſe, and follow me:</hi> If we will follow Chriſt, we muſt bid farewell to our own wils, &amp; to our own eaſe, and to the ſweet times that are paſt for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man; we muſt deny ourſelues and we muſt take vp Chriſts Croſſe: what Croſſe? It is a daily Croſſe, <hi>Luk. 9.23.</hi> a continuall ſucceſſion of tryals &amp; afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that we are daily exerciſed withall: And in the 14. Chapter of <hi>Luk.</hi> 26. Verſe, our Sauiour enlargeth it with many particulars, <hi>If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and brethren, and ſiſters, yea, and his owne life alſo, he cannot be my diſciple</hi>; Here are croſſes of all ſorts; And this wee muſt make account of before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand;
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:2715:70"/>
for ſo our Sauiour in <hi>Luke 14.28.</hi> doth ſet it out, by an excellent example of him that buildeth a Tower, <hi>which of you minding to build a Tower, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not downe firſt, and counteth the coſt?</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, your ſauing faith and Religion will coſt you deare, it will coſt you many afflictions and croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of all ſorts, and therefore you muſt make your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſo before-hand, for it will ſurely come vpon you: And marke how our Sauiour hampers vs by the diuers manner of his ſpeech, and puts vs by all our ſhifts: In <hi>Matthew</hi> our Sauiour ſpeakes it by way of exhortation, <hi>If any man will follow mee, let him reſolutely take vp his Croſſe, &amp;c.</hi> In <hi>Luke</hi> hee ſpeakes it by way of Commination, <hi>If any man come to me and hate not father and mother, he cannot bee my diſciple:</hi> And hee puts vs preciſely vpon this choiſe, either you muſt reſolue to forſake your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and ſtand out in oppoſition againſt Chriſt; or elſe you muſt reſolue to forſake your ſelues, and all that you haue, and ſuffer, and liue in expectation of oppoſition from all the world, to forſake all the world, and liue in oppoſition to that, <hi>Act. 14.22. Paul and Barnabas confirmed the hearts of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that wee muſt through many afflictions en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the kingdome of God:</hi> The people had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the faith before, and they come to confirme them in it; And how do they confirme them in it? By affirming that through many afflictions we muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the kingdome of God There are two things in the ſpeech that directly anſwere to two points in this our Doctrine: Firſt, that the faithfull ſhall bee
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:2715:71"/>
aſſaulted with afflictions; yea, with many <hi>afflictions:</hi> they muſt, a neceſſity is laid vpon them, it is their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euitable portion; Afflictions are as the gate to the kingdome of God, for ſo the ſpeech intends; through many afflictions we muſt <hi>enter</hi> into the kingdome of God: Secondly, that this perſwaſion is a ſpeciall meanes to confirme their hearts, and to make them to continue in the faith, and therefore, they muſt make account of it before hand, that ſo it muſt bee. We haue an example of this in all Gods children that are regiſtred in Gods booke, and as they were more excellent in grace, ſo they were more eminent in afflictions; ſee it in the former, and in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Teſtament; In the former Teſtament, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44 22. Surely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Firſt, it is for reproofe of carnall men, and firſt of ſome that reproach our Chriſtian ſtate and profeſſion, and brand it with the marke of eaſe and idleneſſe. To

reſt vpon the Sabboth, and to goe to Church, and to ſit ſtill and heare the Word, and receiue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to ſay ouer now and then a few prayers; this is an eaſie life, ſay they, and an idle profeſſion. Firſt, I anſwere to the perſon; Thou prophane worldling that ſaiſt thus, let mee tell thee; If the Chriſtian life be ſo eaſie as thou ſaiſt, it is the more ſhame for thee, that wilt not leade this life; it is the onely way to heauen, and if it be ſo eaſie as thou wouldſt make it to be, what a horrible ſhame, yea, what a fooliſhneſſe is it for thee, that thou wilt take a great deale more paines to goe to hell, then thou mighteſt take and goe to heauen? I ſpeake this to thee in thine owne language, that wilt make it to be ſo eaſie. But ſecondly, I anſwere to the matter, and I ſay, that a Chriſtian life rightly managed, is a moſt hard &amp; laborious life, ſubiect to all reproches, croſſes, trials, loſſes, perſecutions, wounds of conſcience, &amp; breakings of the heart, fightings, ſpoylings, ſubiect to the malice of men, &amp; to the rage of the Diuell, ſubiect to killings of all ſorts, and that which is moſt tedious &amp; irkeſome of all other, ſubiect to a continuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate betwixt the fleſh and the Spirit in our own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes; theſe &amp; all other dangers and tryals, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian life and ſtate is ſubiect vnto; I ſay, a Chriſtian life is ſubiect to all theſe, but not ſo as to be ouercome by them, but as alwayes exerciſed with them, ſo as we muſt wraſtle and ſtruggle with them, all the dayes of our liues, &amp; that vpon the very hazard of our ſoules if this bee an eaſie life, there is none hard vnder the Sunne: It is true, it is an eaſie and comfortable life in a ſpirituall ſence, but a carnall man cannot
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:2715:75"/>
reach vnto this: Cuſtome in afflictions makes it ea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſie, the promiſes of God makes it eaſie, the fellowſhip of Chriſt in our afflictions makes it eaſie, the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the Spirit, and the hope of the reward of glory; theſe things make a Chriſtian life eaſie and comfortable to vs in regard of the inward man: the regenerate part delights in nothing more, then in mortifying and crucifying this body or ſinne, which is notably effected by theſe afflictions. Hence it is that it is eaſie and comfortable to the ſpirituall man, becauſe hee findes his Aduerſary, the fleſh, weaker then it was, that beginnes to die. For our corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are killed by afflictions, being ſanctified to the hearts of Gods children; yet ſtill I maintaine it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this ſcandall, that a Chriſtian life rightly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged in it ſelfe, in regard of the outward ſtate of it in this world, is moſt hard and laborious.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is for reproofe of others that are without, that iudge hardly of Gods children, becauſe of their afflictions: If they ſee a Profeſſor much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted and troubled, either outwardly or inwardly, or both, they are ready to paſſe hard cenſures on them; Surely ſay they, whatſoeuer theſe men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be, yet they are but groſſe hypocrites, and notorious ſinners; thus they adde affliction to the afflicted: God afflicts vs with his heauy chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the world afflicts vs more with their bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and heauy cenſures: but if this Doctrine be true, as it is, that all Gods children are ſubiect to all affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, then ſurely wee haue more reaſon to iudge more fauourably of them that are afflicted moſt, then of them that are afflicted leaſt: <hi>Iob</hi> was thus

cenſured by his friends, but it was their errour, as God himſelfe ſhewes <hi>Iob, Iob</hi> 42.7. And ſo was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> by his enemies, but it was their malice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.8. <hi>A miſchiefe is light vpon him</hi> (ſay they) <hi>and he that ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſhall no more riſe:</hi> Thus did the Barbarians cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of <hi>Paul</hi> becauſe of the Viper that hung on his hand, that he was a murtherer, <hi>Act,</hi> 28.4. but this was their ſauageneſſe: <hi>Dauid</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth that he was neere vnto this point, to condemne the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Righteous becauſe of their afflictions, but he confeſſeth it was his folly and his ignorance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.12. to the 22. and that hee was as a beaſt herein: And ſurely to condemne the generation of the Righteous for their afflictions, is a fooliſh and an ignorant, and beaſtly cenſure, I ſay beaſtly, as hee ſaith; becauſe as a beaſt is lead onely by preſent ſence, and not by vnderſtanding: ſo theſe vnchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table cenſurers are carried away onely with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſence of our afflictions, not vnderſtanding nor conſidering, that all kindes of affl<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Why ſhould we ſorrow before-hand? I anſwere, yet we muſt looke for them before-hand, for if we do ſo, then if they do not come (as haply thy godly feare hath preuented them,) we haue cauſe to bleſſe God for it: If they doe come, then if wee haue made account of them before, the ſmart of them wil be much eaſier vnto vs, temptations, &amp; troubles, and loſſes, when they come vnawares, they do commonly lie very hard and heauy vpon vs; but when we haue made account of them before-hand, they are much lighter to vs. I will not deny but that we muſt vſe all poſſible meanes to auoid afflictions, we muſt pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, &amp; preuent them what we can, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour prayed; <hi>If it be poſsible, let this cup paſſe from me, Luk.</hi> 22. yet wee muſt make account of them before-hand. Theſe times wee liue in are ſuch as call vpon
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:2715:77"/>
vs to looke for afflictions, they are the laſt dayes of the world, and they are the worſt and moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous times; preſent troubles and miſeries, and immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent dangers and feares, there were neuer more; The Lord is abroad in Iudgement, and carries his cup in his hand; the <hi>Germans</hi> drinke of it firſt; the <hi>French</hi> ſoone after; the <hi>Polonians</hi> ſoone after them; and haue not the <hi>Engliſh</hi> iuſt cauſe to feare, that wee ſhall pledge them, and that ere long, we know not how ſoone? Secondly, againe this teacheth vs not onely to account of afflictions before-hand, but alſo to prepare for them, and to furniſh our ſelues accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly; there is much good to be had by them, and therefore we are to prepare for them; and therefore doth God warne vs of dangers before-hand, that we might be armed to beare them, when they doe come.<note place="margin">Things to be laboured for that we may beare afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> And that we may prepare for them, we muſt labour for theſe things; Firſt, wee muſt labour to get a reſolution in vs to beare them, and to ſtand it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> out to the death; we muſt reſolue with the Apoſtle, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 21.13. not onely to ſuffer, but to die with Chriſt; Secondly, we muſt ſeaſon our hearts with the comforts of Gods promiſes before-hand, to counteruaile our afflictions when they come, as that he will neuer faile vs nor forſake vs, that he loues vs, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and that the iſſue ſhall be good; Thirdly, eſteeme baſely and vildely of thy ſelfe, deny thy ſelfe, and ſo take vp thy Croſſe and follow Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.24. If we be choiſe and leaning to our ſelues, we will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> endure the Croſſe, compare <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.20. with <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7.

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2715:77"/>
of proofe againſt all afflictions, to know <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> and him crucified, by ſenſible experience in our ſelues: If I finde the life of Gods Spirit in me, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the death of Chriſt to mee, and thereby ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and crucifying my ſinnes, if we can finde this, we ſhall be well armed againſt all afflictions. We come here to receiue the Lords Supper, in remembrance of Chriſts death, then let vs deſire to be made confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to his death, and then afflictions will be ſweet vnto vs. Againe, let vs labour for the aſſurance of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Gods loue and fauour, for that is it that makes the Apoſtle thus boldly to beare vp himſelfe againſt all afflictions.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſeauenth and laſt head that we reduced this Scripture vnto, was the comfort and ſupport that the Apoſtle hath in the loue of God through Ieſus Chriſt, againſt all feares and terrours whatſoeuer: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I obſerued two things. Firſt, the dangers of Gods children: Secondly, the comfort whereby they are ſuſtayned in them: Of both theſe I propounded to ſpeake firſt in generall, and then in perticular: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with the dangers in generall, and ſhewed; That the dangers which Gods children are ſubiect vnto, are not onely ſuch as they are ſubiect to with the reſt of the world, but alſo ſuch as they alone are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto, as perſecution for Chriſts ſake, &amp;c. Now in the next place; wee are to ſpeake in generall of the comfort which Gods children are ſupported withall againſt all dangers; and that is the true and holy aſſurance which they haue of the loue of God to them in Chriſt Ieſus. Now this comfort the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth extend and ſtretch out here, vpon a double ſtraine; firſt by way of ſuppoſition; ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by way of inſultation and triumph: Firſt, by way
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:2715:79"/>
of ſuppoſition, for ſo his ſpeech is to be taken, as if he ſhould ſay, ſuppoſe, or put the caſe, that <hi>death, or life or Angels, &amp;c.</hi> ſhould ſet themſelues againſt vs to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow vs, yet in the ſtrength of my aſſurance which I haue of the loue of God in Chriſt Ieſus, I am comforted &amp; ſupported againſt them all: Secondly, the Apoſtle ſpeaks by way of inſultation or triumph, for, that the Apoſtle ſo intends it, appeares partly by his manner of ſpeech in the 35. Verſe, <hi>Who ſhall ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate vs?</hi> as if he ſpake theſe things ſleighting them, and inſulting ouer them; and more plainely in the 37. Verſ. <hi>in all theſe things wee are more then Conquerours, &amp;c.</hi> and thence be infers his proteſtation, <hi>for I am ſure that neither death nor life, &amp;c.</hi> ſo that he ſpeakes theſe words as a Conquerour, by way of Triumph: ſo that this comfort which he hath in this aſſurance, is not a weake comfort, but a marueilous ſtrong comfort, ſuch a comfort that in the ſtrength thereof, hee may and doth inſult and triumph ouer all dangers what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer. Theſe circumſtances conſidered, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ariſeth naturally thus, namely;</p>
               <p>Let vs propound to our ſelues what dangers ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer may befall vs,<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> yet notwithſtanding the true and holy aſſurance that we haue of the loue of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs in Chriſt Ieſus, ſhall be able to comfort and ſupport our hearts againſt them all: euen to a holy inſultation and triumph ouer them. There are two Queſtions to be conſidered of in the practiſe of the Apoſtle, and ſo in this Doctrine: The firſt queſtion is; Whether it be lawfull, or fit, for Gods Children to propound feares and dangers to themſelues in their owne meditations? Secondly, how it can ſtand with
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:2715:80"/>
diſtreſſed Beleeuers, that they ſhould triumph &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult ouer their afflictions? For the firſt queſtion, ſome will ſay, haue we not ſenſible feares &amp; dangers enough vpon vs daily, euen as much as we can ſtand vnder, &amp; ſhal we increaſe our burthen, &amp; propound more and greater feares and dangers to our ſelues. I anſwere, yes, they may do it, &amp; they ought to doe it, &amp; it is no increaſing, but a lightning of our burthen. If a man haue a grim and ſterne aduerſary to fight withall, is it not wiſedome for that man, firſt to take a view of that aduerſary, &amp; to looke him in the face, to ſee how he can brooke him before he vndertake to fight with him: Oh beloued, Gods children haue many grim &amp; ſterne enemies to fight withal. Perſecution is a grim &amp; ſterne aduerſary, and all that will liue godly in Chriſt Ieſus, muſt ſuffer perſecution. Temptation is a grim and ſterne enemy, &amp; Gods children muſt be tried with many hideous &amp; feareful temptations, Death is a grim &amp; ſterne enemy, &amp; we muſt paſſe through the terrors, and ſorrowes, &amp; bars of death, to the ioyes of life. Hell is a grim &amp; ſtern enemy, &amp; we muſt make account to touch at the gates of hell, when we ſaile to heauen: The Diuel is a grim &amp; ſtern aduerſary, &amp; Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren muſt fight with Diuels: If wee will be the good Souldiers of Ieſus Chriſt, we muſt wreſtle &amp; fight, not with fleſh &amp; bloud only, but againſt principalities &amp; powers, euen againſt the Diuel himſelfe: And therfore hauing ſo many, &amp; ſo grim, &amp; ſterne enemies, that we muſt fight againſt, haue we not iuſt cauſe then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound ſuch things to our ſelues, in our meditations, to ſee how we can brook them; &amp; to hearten our ſelues againſt the feare &amp; euill of them? Yet herein we muſt
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:2715:80"/>
obſerue two cautions; wee muſt not propound to our ſelues vaine and friuolous matters, without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or ground, (that were to fight with our owne ſhadow) but ſerious thoughts and grounded medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of true dangers, ſuch as may or will befall vs, more or leſſe, firſt or laſt. Secondly, we muſt not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to our ſelues any thoughts of ſinne, for ſin is a defiler, and the leaſt thought or apprehenſion of ſinne will infect vs; Sathan is ſo ſtrong and ſubtle, we are ſo weake and ſimple, that if euer he get vs into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny contemplation of ſinne, as it is ſinne, though it be not with any intent to commit it; nay, though it be with a contrary intent, euen to hate it, and preuent it, yet vſually hee will infect vs with it before wee be aware, ſo that it will leaue a ſtaine behinde: therefore take heede of any ſpeculations or propoſitions of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſinnes, for that is not the way to eſcape them, but rather to be intangled with them, ſpecially me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate not on the materials of ſinne, for that is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding dangerous; we may conſider how hatefull it is to God, and how hurtfull to our own ſoules, but we muſt not meddle with the materials of ſinne. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond queſtion is, how it can ſtand with the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of diſtreſſed Beleeuers, that they ſhould inſult and triumph ouer their afflictions? Alas (may ſome ſay) Gods children are humbled, and mourne, and ſigh, and groane vnder the burthen, and yet doe they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and reioyce ouer them? Yes they do, their mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and inſultation may ſtand well together; they mourne for their preſent paine &amp; griefe, but they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult ouer them in the aſſurance of victory, and of the good they ſhal haue by them. They mourne for their
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:2715:81"/>
ſins that brought their afflictions on them; But they reioyce becauſe they know that by Gods hand theſe afflictions ſhall be made a meanes to cure thoſe very ſinnes that haue procured them; they mourne for the periſhing of the outward man by them, but they inſult that thereby the inward man is renewed daily: In a word, they mourne in themſelues, but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in God: Carnall inſultation doth not befit Gods children, this is an holy inſultation, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes them well. They inſult not, firſt in reſpect of their owne ſtrength (ſuch reioycing is not good) but meerely and onely in the ſtrength of God; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, not ſo much for their owne good and ſafety, but much more for the honour and glory that God ſhall haue by their afflictions, and by their deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and this is a holy and good inſultation: And this is the godly and Chriſtian inſultation of ſtrong Beleeuers againſt all dangers, for that is the reach of the Text; ſtrong Beleeuers may doe it, weake Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers may doe ſo too, but not with that ſence as the other may: Chriſt Ieſus was ſo weake that hee was not able to beare his Croſſe, yet when he was nailed on that Croſſe, he did then openly triumph ouer all his enemies.</p>
               <p>Now come we to the proofe of the obſeruation thus cleared. And firſt we will proue it in the ſtate of the faithfull: Secondly, you ſhall ſee it in the practiſe of the faithfull: And thirdly, you ſhall ſee it in the warrant that Gods children haue for it. Firſt, ſee it proued from the ſtate of the faithfull, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.7.8. <hi>He will not be afraid of euill tidings:</hi> and why? <hi>for his heart is fixed and beleeueth in the Lord</hi>; And for the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:2715:81"/>
more certainty hee doubles vpon it in the 8. <hi>verſe, His heart is ſtabliſhed, therefore hee will not feare, &amp;c.</hi> Who is it that the Prophet ſpeakes of here? Of a true Beleeuer, that is, of him that beleeues in the Lord, and reſts himſelfe ſecurely vpon the Lord for protection: And what is the effect that his Faith ſhall worke in him? ſtrong aſſurance and comfort, it confirmeth and fixeth his heart; And what then? <hi>He ſhall not be afraid of euill tidings:</hi> Againe in the 8. <hi>verſe, His heart is eſtabliſhed</hi>; How farre? Euen to the ſeeing of his deſire vpon his enemies, to the ſubduing and triumphing ouer, and the ſetting of his feet on the neckes of them. See it alſo in the practiſe of the faithfull, how they propound and hearten them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt all dangers that may befall them. It is the practiſe of all the faithfull as well as of <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſome other. It was the practiſe of the whole Church, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.1.2.3. <hi>God is our hope and ſtrength, and helpe in troubles, ready to be found.</hi> Firſt, the Church there layes downe this holy aſſurance for the ground of their comfort, and this is a ſure ground, that <hi>God is our hope and helpe in troubles, &amp;c.</hi> and then ſecondly, they propound to themſelues dangers that may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall them, and ſtrange and fearefull ones too; <hi>The mooning of the Earth, the falling of the Mountaines into the midſt of the Sea, the raging of the Waters,</hi> in the 2. and 3. <hi>verſes,</hi> ſuch dangers as did not come to paſſe in their times; But if they did, what then? Why then laſtly, they gather to themſelues out of this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance matter of conſolation againſt al theſe dangers, <hi>verſe</hi> 2, as who ſhould ſay, Let them roare when they will, we will not feare them, becauſe <hi>the Lord is
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:2715:82"/>
our hope, and ſtrength, and helpe in troubles, ready to bee found.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.1.2.3. it was <hi>Dauids</hi> practiſe in his particular, the matter of the ſpeech is this; <hi>The Lord is Dauids light, and his ſaluation, and the ſtrength of his life</hi>: This he beleeues and is well aſſured of, and therefore he feares nothing; and this hee inlargeth, propounding to himſelfe in the 3. <hi>verſe,</hi> a matter of great feare: What if a whole hoaſt were pitched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him? what though warre bee raiſed againſt him? yet he would not be afraid, he would neuer be put to ſuch a feare as to vnſettle his aſſurance in God: Alas, what is <hi>Dauid</hi> alone to a whole hoaſt of men? Nothing in himſelfe, but in his confidence and aſſurance that he hath in God, they are nothing to him, they ſhall neuer be able to deſtroy him: And if you marke the manner of his ſpeech, he deliuers it by way of inſultation too, <hi>The Lord is my light, whom ſhould I feare</hi>? as ſetting his aduerſaries at nought, and his heart triumphing in God againſt them all: And that no man ſhould thinke this was a matter pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to <hi>Dauid</hi> by prerogatiue, he makes it the caſe of euery true beleeuer, &amp; calls vpon them for the ſame practiſe in the 14. <hi>verſe, Hope in the Lord, and be ſtrong, and hee ſhall comfort thine heart, &amp;c.</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, It is not my caſe alone, but yours too; get you a ſure faith in God, and ſound aſſurance as I haue, and thereby you ſhall bee comforted againſt all dangers, as I am. Thirdly, behold this in the warrant that Gods children haue for it; they haue good warrant for it, euen from God himſelfe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.10. <hi>Feare not thou, for I am with thee, be not afraid, for I am thy God, I will ſtrengthen thee, and helpe thee, &amp;c.</hi> And in the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:2715:82"/>
12. <hi>verſe, All their enemies ſhall bee as nothing, and the men that warre againſt them as a thing of nought.</hi> The drift of the Prophets ſpeech, is this; The Lord would haue his children to take heart to themſelues, and to be feareleſſe of dangers; What muſt they do then? Why, let them get ſound aſſurance in God, and in his power, helpe, and loue, and then all their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites ſhall be as a thing of nought, they may ſcorne them. And ſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.1.2. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, that created thee (oh Iacob) and hee that formed thee (oh Iſrael,) I haue redeemed thee, and haue called thee by thy name, thou art mine. When thou paſſeſt through the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters I will be with thee, and through the flouds, that they doe not ouerflow thee; when thou walkeſt through the fire thou ſhalt not be burnt, &amp;c.</hi> It may bee they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer fall into theſe dangers, but it is ſpoken by way of ſuppoſition, as if God ſhould ſay; If thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt fall into theſe or any other dangers, yet in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that God ſaith vnto vs, <hi>thou art mine,</hi> we ſhall ſafely and triumphantly paſſe through the fire, and through the water, and through all dangers that euer can be imagined, &amp; ſo, that we ſhall receiue no dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage by them in regard of our ſpirituall eſtate, and we ſhall haue comfort in them in regard of our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eſtate. And ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. from the firſt to the laſt verſe; <hi>Who ſo dwells in the ſecret of the moſt high, ſhall abide in the ſhadow of the Almighty, &amp;c.</hi> One would thinke at the firſt ſight that this were a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of one and the ſame thing; for, what is it to dwell in the ſecret of the moſt high, but to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in the ſhadow of the Almighty? It ſeemes to bee the ſame, but it is not ſo: The former part
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:2715:83"/>
of the verſe ſhewes the aſſurance that Gods children haue in the loue of God, <hi>they dwell or repoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in God</hi>; the latter part ſhewes their ſafety and ſecurity that by his aſſurance they attaine vnto, <hi>they abide in the ſhadow of the Almighty,</hi> that is, they are ſafe ſheltered vnder the ſhadow of the Almighty. And theſe two the Prophet enlargeth in the reſt of the Pſalme: their aſſurance in the 2. <hi>verſe, I will ſay vnto the Lord (oh my hope and my fortreſſe) hee is my God, in him will I truſt</hi>; Here is the repoſe of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God; but what is their ſafety? it followes in the reſt of the Pſalme, ſafety againſt ordinary dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, <hi>The noiſome peſtilence, the flying arrowes, &amp;c.</hi> in the 3.5. and 6. <hi>verſes.</hi> Againſt ſuppoſed dangers, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. <hi>A thouſand ſhall fall as thy ſide, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand at thy right hand, but it ſhall not come neere thee</hi>; And againſt likely dangers in the verſes following. And in the 13. <hi>verſe,</hi> hee ſtretcheth out the ſafety of Gods children euen to inſultation, <hi>Thou ſhalt walke vpon the Lyon and the Aſpe, the young Lyon and the Dragon ſhalt thou treade vnder foote.</hi> Seeing then that this Doctrine agrees ſo fitly with the ſtate, practiſe, and warrant of the faithfull, then it muſt needs be an vndoubted truth, that let vs propound to our ſelues whatſoeuer dangers may befall vs, yet our holy and true aſſurance of Gods loue to vs in Chriſt Ieſus, is able to comfort and ſupport our hearts againſt them all, euen to an holy inſultation and triumphing ouer them.</p>

God doth not turne out his children ſingle to the battell to ſhift for themſelues, but he goes forth with vs himſelfe, and helpes vs, and comforts vs, and ſtrengthens vs, and incourageth vs, and teacheth vs, and maketh vs to fight, and fights himſelfe for vs, and gets the victory for vs, and this our faith aſſures vs of, and this comforts the hearts of Gods children, and makes them confident againſt all dangers. In the 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 6.15, 16, 17. when the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> his ſeruant ſaw the great hoaſt that compaſſed the City, he was much terrified, and cries out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Alas Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, how ſhall wee doe?</hi> The Prophet anſweres him, <hi>Feare not, they that be with vs are more then they that be with them.</hi> This is like our caſe, when Gods children looke about them, and ſee a whole hoaſt of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, dangers, perſecutions, and temptations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them about on euery ſide, they cry out in their weakeneſſe, Alas! what ſhall wee doe? Our Faith that anſwers; Feare not, there be more with vs then there is againſt vs. Is not God more then all the world? God is with vs, and this aſſures and comforts our hearts. How ſweetly doth <hi>Dauid</hi> caſt himſelfe vpon God in his greateſt dangers? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.4. <hi>Though I walke through the valley of the ſhadow of death, I will feare none euill</hi>: why? <hi>for thou art with me, thy Rod and thy Staffe they comfort me.</hi> God is not only with him, but he is with him to comfort him, &amp; therfore he will not feare.</p>

that no affliction can hurt vs, as ſin can hurt vs, that is, to condemnation, they cannot put vs out of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God, they ſhall neuer be able to ſeperate vs from the ſtate of grace here, nor glory hereafter: and this is fulneſſe of comfort to the ſpirituall man, that can well reliſh it; wee haue no further priuiledge (from the warrant of the word) by the charter of our freedome in Chriſt, but this, that our afflictions ſhall neuer hurt vs, in regard of our ſpirituall eſtate, they ſhall neuer impeach our ſpirituall ſafety, ſo long as our ſinnes are forgiuen; for our ſinnes are the poiſon and venome of all our afflictions; when God ſhootes the Arrowes of his iudgements againſt vs, dipt in the venome of our ſinnes, they are deadly Arrowes, they will poyſon vs, to our euerlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: But when they are dipt in the death and blood of Ieſus Chriſt, whereby our ſinnes are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and taken away, then though his Arrowes doe wound vs, it is a good wound, a comfortable wound, and ſuch as he will heale himſelfe with his own hand; ſo that they cannot hurt vs but comfort vs: And if we be taken away by ſuch an Arrow, God takes vs to himſelfe, and that is beſt of all.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, our faith tels vs, <hi>That all things ſhall <label type="milestone">

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> And ſecondly this ſhewes the Reaſon, why the wicked are ſo fearefull that <hi>they flye when none purſues them, Pro.</hi> 28.1. and that they call for the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to fall vpon them, to hide them from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, <hi>Reu.</hi> 6.16.17. Why? the Reaſon is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their harts are deſtitute of this holy aſſurance, and therefore they wanting this comfortable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion and aſſurance of the loue of God to warme their hearts, therefore they are ſo cold at the heart, and therefore they are ready to runne into Rockes and holes to hide themſelues: Some wicked men before trouble comes, ſet a good face on it, &amp; thinke highly of themſelues, &amp; ſay they haue as good a faith in God as any of them all; but when it comes, &amp; that they ſee they cannot put it off by ſports and ſtarting holes, as they did before, then their hearts faile them, and then they grow to fearefull and deſperate out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages. Oh Beloued, a man that truely feare God, needes feare nothing elſe; Euery true beleeuer hath this true feare of God, and that makes him feareleſſe of any thing elſe: an vnbeleeuer hath none of this feare of God; and therefore hee hath iuſt cauſe to feare all things elſe: And it is the iuſt iudgement of God to giue them ouer to theſe baſe and ſlauiſh feares of all things elſe, becauſe they regard not the true feare of God. It is true that the ſtrongeſt belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hath his feares, but they are naturall, and are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:2715:86"/>
by the Spirit of God, and the power of faith in him; But the wicked are neuer endued with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God to worke faith in their hearts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are ſlaues to the moſt ſlauiſh feares.</p>
               <p>The third Vſe teacheth vs what wrong men doe to themſelues, in that they doe not labour for this holy aſſurance: They depriue themſelues of the greateſt comfort that they can poſſibly haue in life or in death. This therefore is for reproofe of many Profeſſors, that will pretend to haue faith, but they care not for this aſſurance of faith; if God giue it, well and good, if not, they will not labour for it, they thinke they haue faith enough to ſaue their owne ſoules. There are diuers cauſes of this ſinne,<note place="margin">Seauen cauſes why men la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour not for aſſurance.</note> that men will not labour for this aſſurance of faith; Firſt, ſome account it altogether needleſſe, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they looke not after it: Will not ordinary aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſay they, ſerue the turne? Is it needleſſe? This is ſtrange; Can any man be too ſure of his owne ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation? Can we be more ſure then needs of eternall life? It cannot be. Vſually ſuch perſons as theſe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liuing or dying finde the want of it, and rue it, to their great diſcomfort; I haue ſeene the woefull experience of that which I ſpeake, and I haue obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the righteous Iudgement of God vpon them: Time will come when we ſhall haue more neede of it then we are aware.</p>
               <p>Secondly, others pretend modeſty, they ſay they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> dare not be ſo bold as to determine reſolutely vpon their ſaluation: It is Gods ſecret, and they may not ſearch into it. I anſwere: It is a ſecret indeed, but yet ſuch a ſecret as God reueales ordinarily to the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:2715:87"/>
and to his familiars. <hi>God will ſay to his ſoule, I am thy ſaluation,</hi> and therefore this is a ſimple, and a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full modeſty, not to be ſo bold as to ſeeke and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that that God offers vs and bids vs ſeeke and take, and which if we ſeeke, we are ſure to find; and therefore this is a curſed modeſty, to ſay, what ſhall I be ſo bold as to ſearch into this? This is ſomewhat like the vnprofitable ſeruant, that hid his talent and ſaid he was afraid to vſe it, <hi>Matth,</hi> 25.24.25. But ſee what followes; This wicked and ſloathfull ſeruant muſt be <hi>caſt into vtter darkeneſſe, where ſhall bee wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and gnaſhing of teeth, verſe</hi> 26. to 30.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, others pretend that they haue no time, at leaſt not time enough to get it; It is a long time in getting, ſay they, and you will not deny but that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, it is gotten by long practiſe; God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times giues it extraordinarily at an inſtant, but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily it is a long time in getting, and wee haue no
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:2715:87"/>
time to labour for it. I would aske them that thus pretend want of time: why God did giue them all their time; Did he not doe it of purpoſe, that thou mightſt learne to know him, and to beleeue in him, and to obey him, and to get aſſurance of his loue and fauour in Chriſt? And haſt thou time for all things elſe, and not for this? Haſt thou time to eate and to drinke, and to doe other worldly buſineſſes, yea to learne Religion too, ſo farre as thou doſt affect it; and yet haſt thou no time to acquaint thy ſelfe with the promiſes of God, that thou maiſt get this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? This thou doeſt not affect nor deſire, and therefore thou haſt no time to get it; If thou hadſt a deſire to get it, and if thou didſt know the comfort of it, thou wouldſt ſerue thy ſelfe vpon all times and ſeaſons, both Sabboth day and weeke dayes, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all exerciſes, not onely ſpirituall, but euen euery buſineſſe thou takeſt in hand, to helpe thee forward to get this aſſurance of ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, others ſay, it is impoſſible, or at leaſt very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> difficult to begotten, they will not trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues about it. I anſwere, it is not impoſſible to be had, <hi>Iob</hi>: and <hi>Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and others had it: If it be impoſſible with men, yet it is not impoſſible with God, and it is the worke of God, and not of man; I grant it is hard and difficult to be got, but ſo are all ſpirituall and heauenly things; neuer thinke to come to heauen but through many difficulties; Oh poore ſoule! if thou didſt know the admirable comfort and ſweetneſſe that this aſſurance will bring vnto thy ſoule both here and for euer, thou wouldeſt endure and paſſe, by all difficulties to attaine it.</p>

This many haue proued true by experience, &amp; therfore they, like the <hi>Gadarens,</hi> had rather leaue Chriſt, then looſe their ſwine; ſo theſe had rather deſperately looſe the Aſſurance of their ſaluation, then leaue their filthy ſinnes; and ſo they preferre their ſwyniſh ſinne before the ſweeteſt comfort of the ſoule: A fearefull practiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seauenthly. Others compare their faith with the faith of the ordinary ſort of profeſſors: They ſay they ſee not ſuch ſtrong aſſurance in them, and therefore they lift not to be ſingular, they will ſtay in that they haue: But firſt tell mee, how doeſt thou know that others haue not ſuch a ſtrong aſſurance? they may haue it for ought thou knoweſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to thee this is a falſe ground. But ſecondly, ſay they haue it not, ſay that the world be deſtitute of it; this is no excuſe to thee, ſeeing God will haue thee to haue it, thou muſt not liue by mens examples, but by Gods lawes. Thirdly, if thou wilt needs follow the example of men in this; follow the example not of the worſt, but of the beſt, as <hi>Abraham, Iob, Dauid, Paul, &amp;c.</hi> follow theſe, for theſe hath God of purpoſe propounded, and ſet downe in Scripture as pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns for vs to imitate, euen in this grace of aſſurance: And know, that ſeeing all the ancient Fathers had it,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:2715:88"/>
and it was their greateſt grace, therefore it is a ſhame for vs that we haue it not in ſome meaſure. All theſe and ſuch like, are but gulls and deluſions of Sathan to depriue men of their greateſt comfort in life and death, and of the ſtrongeſt proppe of the kingdome of grace. Let vs therefore examine our ſelues, and ſee whether euery one of vs be not guilty of all or ſome of theſe; and if wee be, no maruell then if wee haue ſo little aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">Motiues to moue vs to looke that our aſſurance be true &amp; ſound.</note> ſeeing this aſſurance is of ſuch excellent <label type="milestone">

If the principalls of a houſe be not ſound timber, the houſe muſt fall. Thou art ſure to be ſifted and tryed to the vttermoſt, either liuing, or dying, therefore ſee that thy aſſurance, that muſt beare theſe trialls, be ſound and good A man that hath good euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for his Land, dare bide tryall of his Title againſt all enemies; but if they be counterfeit, hee dare not bide the triall. And ſo, if our aſſurance be ſound and good, we dare bide the triall of all afflictions; if not, we will neuer ſtand to the triall.</p>
               <p>Secondly, conſider Sathans pollicy, when he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> draw vs away from ſeeking ſound aſſurance, then he will put a tricke vpon vs, &amp; he will labour to make vs beleeue wee haue it, when indeed wee haue it not: And therefore let vs ſee that it be true and ſound, and let vs take heed wee miſtake not the Diuels aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for Gods; a ſhamefull miſtake.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, by the cauſe of our aſſurance, how it was wrought in thee; Was it wrought by the word and by the ſpirit? Hath God made thee well acquainted with his promiſes reuealed in his word, that hee will neuer faile thee, nor forſake thee? Doeſt thou finde the ſpirit of God to incline thine heart to remember them, and to beleeue them, to reſt vpon them, and to apply them to thine owne heart as the vndoubted truth of God; and that heauen and earth ſhall faile, but not one tittle of them ſhall faile? Doeſt thou find that thou haſt thy part in them, and that they do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to thee being in Chriſt, as well as to any belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer? If it be ſo with thee, then thy aſſurance is ſound and good, elſe it is not ſound, except it ariſe from this cauſe; for Gods word is the word of truth, his ſpirit is the ſpirit of truth, and they teach and worke no lye, but looke whatſoeuer grace they teach and worke, the ſame is a true grace without exception: therefore if thy aſſurance ariſe from theſe, it is ſound and good, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.49. <hi>Remember thy promiſe made to thy ſeruant, wherein thou haſt cauſed me to truſt.</hi> When the Lord acquaints vs with his word and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and cauſeth vs by his ſpirit to put our truſt in them, this is a ſound and true aſſurance that ſhall ſtand in remembrance before God for euer: The contrary, counterfeit aſſurance and vaine preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is fetcht and doth ariſe from other cauſes, as main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,

welfare in outward things, ſelfe-loue, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans flattery, ſoothings vp of men, and ſuch like; but this is preſumption, and neuer comes from the word and ſpirit. An hypocrite may ſay he doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the promiſes of God to himſelfe, and that his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance ariſeth from thence, and may haue ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture running in his head ſometimes ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that effect; yet indeed he miſ-vnderſtands the word, and miſ-applyes the promiſes, and they are not ſeconded by Gods ſpirit in their hearts, cauſing them to put their truſt in the promiſes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, looke into the Riſe of our aſſurance,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and what is that? It is when our aſſurance is gotten and doth ariſe vpon and after hearty and vnfained repentance for ſinne, and vpon hearty praier to God: oh, when a poore ſinnefull ſoule findes that hee is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerladen with ſinne, and hath the ſence of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then thereof in his heart, and goes to God, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles himſelfe for it throughly before the Lord, with ſighes and groanes vnſpeakeable, and hath bedewed himſelfe with the teares of a troubled head, and a broken heart, and hath pleaded effectually the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of all his ſinnes in the death of Chriſt, and the grace of reformation by his ſpirit, then is that ſoule in a fit caſe to receiue this aſſurance. And vſually in this caſe God ſtirres vp the heart to begge this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and in this caſe vſually God giues it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.1.2.3.8.12. <hi>Dauid</hi> pleads hard for the forgiueneſſe of his ſinnes, for iuſtification, and ſanctification; and he addes this petition more, <hi>Reſtore to me the ioy of thy ſaluation, ſtabliſh mee with thy free ſpirit</hi>; and vpon this petition God gaue it him: Counterfeit aſſurance,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:2715:90"/>
and vaine preſumption hath no ſuch riſe; but it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth from a benummed conſcience, and from a dead ſpirit. I neuer doubted (ſay ſome) but haue good aſſurance of Gods loue in Chriſt, and all ſhall goe well with mee: True, becauſe thou haſt a dead conſcience, and art paſt feeling, and art not ſenſible of thy danger, as a dead man feeles no hurt, becauſe he is dead, and ſo it is with thy dead and benummed conſcience.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, we may know whether our aſſurance be ſound &amp; good from the nature of it: True aſſurance is humble and lowly, and ſtands not vpon its owne ſtrength, but it ſtands vpon the ſtrength, power, and goodneſſe of God; <hi>They came about me like Bees</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.11.12. <hi>but in the name of the Lord I ſhall deſtroy them: Dauid</hi> neuer makes menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his owne ſtrength, but of Gods. <hi>Goliah</hi> was confident in himſelfe, but hee had a ſhamefull fall; <hi>Dauid</hi> was confident in God, and had a glorious vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. Let vs therefore humble our ſelues in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of our owne weakeneſſe, and let vs reſt vpon the ſtrength of God in Chriſt, and that is true aſſurance.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Laſtly, let vs looke vpon the fruit of our aſſurance: Is it ioyned with a godly life? The ſame ſpirit that is the ſpirit of adoption, to aſſure vs of our ſaluation, is alſo the ſpirit of ſanctification to renew vs, and to make vs liue a godly life; and none can haue this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance but he that leads a godly life, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.3. <hi>He that hath this hope in him purgeth himſelfe.</hi> If therefore thou ſayeſt thou haſt this aſſurance, and art not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from thy ſinnes, thou art a lyer: When we ſinne,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:2715:90"/>
eſpecially againſt conſcience, our aſſurance much decayes, as fire when water is caſt vpon it: But if thou beeſt purged from thy ſinne, it will make thee more ſure, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9, 10. <hi>Hee that hath not theſe things, &amp;c. hath forgotten that hee was purged from his olde ſinnes; but he that doth theſe things,</hi> he that endeauours to leade a godly life, and to ſtand it out to death, <hi>he ſhall neuer fall.</hi>

               <p>All true Beleeuers are in good ſafetie vnder Gods aſſured protection againſt all dangers in life &amp; death.<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> That the Doctrine may be the better vnderſtood, and beleeued, take theſe two points for explication. Firſt,<note place="margin">Explication.</note> conſider the dangers that are offered vnto vs in life and death: Secondly, let vs conſider how farre all true beleeuers are in ſafety againſt them. And firſt we will beginne with the dangers of life:<note place="margin">Two dangers of life.</note> Life indangers vs two wayes, either on the right
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:2715:92"/>
hand, when we are too much in loue with it: Or on the left hand, when we are too much out of loue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> with it. On the right hand, life is in it ſelfe very ſweet, and much deſired and delighted in; but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when it is ſeconded with outward comforts, as health, friends, eaſe, goods, honours, &amp;c. then it is much more ſweet and deſired. Yea, but Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren muſt know, that they muſt deny themſelues, &amp; forſake their own wills, they muſt be crucified to the whole world, &amp; the world muſt be crucified to them: yea, and happily they muſt bee called out to looſe their liues for Chriſt, and for his Goſpell. Now here is the danger, whether they will looſe their ſweet liues, or their ſweet ſoules, many of Gods deare chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren haue bin put to great plunges in this kind. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe, though hee loued his Maſter dearely, and profeſt that hee would neuer forſake him, but reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to dye with him; yet when it came to the triall, for the brunt of the proofe, that either hee muſt forſake his Maſter, or his life; <hi>Peter</hi> had rather forſake his beſt Maſter, then his ſweet life. When ſuch tall Cedars ſhrinke in ſuch a ſtorme, alas poore ſoules, what ſhal become of vs the low ſhrubs? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Againe, life indangers on the left hand by croſſes, whereby wee are too much out of loue with it: After a time of well fare comes loſſes, wants, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentments, ſickneſſes, paines, infirmities, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, perſecutions, terrours of conſcience, they come. What are wee to doe in this caſe? Here are great dangers towards vs; our hearts droope, our ſpirits are dying, wee are a burthen to our ſelues, wee are weary of our liues, heere is our
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:2715:92"/>
danger: Now, whether are wee content pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to endure this dying life, or deſperately to deſire an vntimely death? This was a danger of <hi>Ionas</hi> 4.3. <hi>It is better for mee</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>to dye then to liue:</hi> A fearefull ſpeech of a Prophet of the Lord: And ſo it was a danger of <hi>Iob, chap.</hi> 7.15. <hi>My ſoule chuſeth rather to be ſtrangled, and to dye:</hi> Yea, many of Gods deare children haue beene ſo hardly put to it in this kinde, that they haue beene tempted to make away themſelues, and to put an end to a weariſome life by a deſperate death; I ſay they haue beene tempted to it, but through Gods mercifull protection they haue beene kept from it: Here are the dangers of life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Death</hi> endangers vs another way:<note place="margin">How death in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangers man.</note> The very name of death is terrible to vs; and ſometime the time of our death doth diſmay vs; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the manner of our death troubles vs; but the matter of death that ſcarres vs moſt of all, when wee thinke with our ſelues, that now wee muſt die, and giue vp the Ghoſt, and leaue all the world, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake this preſent light that ſhines about vs; when the body and ſoule muſt part, that haue been all this while louing friends together; the body to returne to the duſt, as it was, and the ſoule to God that gaue it; when wee thinke with our ſelues of the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſowreneſſe, and pangs of death, and of our particular Iudgement in death; and the generall iudgement that ſhall come after death, and begin to feele theſe things come vpon vs, here is our danger: Many of the children of God haue beene ready vpon their conſideration hereof, to let goe their hold in
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:2715:93"/>
God, and to ſay that God doth not loue them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he deales ſo rigorouſlly and extreamely with them herein: Adde herevnto that we may ſaue our liues, and eſcape all theſe feares for the time, if wee will our ſelues, as in the caſe of perſecution, if we will forſake our Religion and deny our faith, wee may ſaue our liues; then the ſweetneſſe of life alluring vs on the one ſide, &amp; the feare &amp; terror of death affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vs on the other ſide, makes this a great danger: oh what danger is vpon vs now in this caſe, of our vtter ſeperation from the loue of God in Chriſt Ieſus? This was one of Sathans chiefe bolts, that he ſhot at <hi>Iob, Iob</hi> 2.4. <hi>Skin for skin, and all that euer a man hath will he giue for his life</hi>: Theſe are the dangers of life and death, great dangers, horrible dangers; well, yet whoſoeuer is the childe of God, is in ſafety vnder Gods protection againſt all theſe.</p>
               <p>Therefore the ſecond point is to know, how farre the children of God are in ſafety againſt all theſe dangers? They are not exempted from any of theſe dangers in reſpect of the matter of them, for ſo all things fall out alike to all, to the iuſt and to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, <hi>Preach.</hi> 9.2. <hi>There are ſome dangers of life, and ſome of death, and they fall alike to good and bad:</hi> yea but the faithfull are in ſafety from the euill of all theſe dangers, <hi>Iob</hi> 5.19. <hi>Hee will deliuer thee in ſixe troubles, and the euill of the ſeauenth ſhall not touch thee</hi>; Troubles ſhall be vpon them, but the <hi>euill</hi> of the troubles ſhall not touch them. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 23.4 <hi>Though I ſhould walke in the valley of the ſhadow of death, I will feare no euill: Dauid</hi> might walke in the valley of the ſhadow of death, as well as others, but God is
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:2715:93"/>
with him, therefore he ſhall not feare the euill of the ſhadow of death; And this is as much as our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our prayed for, and obtained for vs, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.15. <hi>I pray not that thou ſhouldeſt take them out of the world, but that thou ſhouldeſt keepe them from euill</hi>; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is as much as we muſt, or can looke for. But what are theſe euils that we are ſubiect to in theſe dangers of life and death? I anſwere;<note place="margin">Foure euils Gods people are freed from in affliction.</note> there are foure ſpeciall euils in the dangers of life and death which all Gods children are freed from, and which all the wicked fall into: The firſt is loſſe of graces; the ſecond is the hardening of the heart by ſinne; the third, is the furtherance of eternall damnation; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the fourth, is the reuenging hand of God. Firſt, loſſe of graces; the ſeeming graces of the wicked may be, and vſually are loſt in their troubles and dangers, their ſeeming faith, their ſeeming repentance, and their ſeeming obedience, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13. In time of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation they fall away, their faith is loſt; but Gods children can neuer looſe their graces by their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, they may decay in ſome graces, and the brightneſſe of them may be dimbd, and their edge blunted by the extremity of their afflictions, but they can neuer be vtterly depriued of them: Nay, ſo farre off are Gods children from looſing their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by their afflictions, that they are gayners in grace by them; by their afflictions their ſinnes and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions are purged, and they come forth like the pure gold as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Iob</hi> 23.10. <hi>He tryeth me, but I ſhall come forth like the gold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond euill is the hardening of the heart in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſinne, the wicked are hardened by their afflictions in
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:2715:94"/>
ſinne: let <hi>Pharaoh</hi> be in danger of Gods iudgements, and he will harden his heart in his ſinnes: but let <hi>Ioſiah</hi> bee in danger of Gods iudgements and his heart will melt at them, and he will humble himſelfe before the Lord: and ſo <hi>Iob</hi> 23.16. <hi>For God hath ſoftened mine heart, and the Almighty hath troubled me: Iobs</hi> troubles ſoftned <hi>Iobs</hi> heart, and made him to feare the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the furtherance of eternall damnation, that is another euill in theſe dangers, to the wicked the tryals which they endure here are the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of hell; All theſe fearefull paſſages that befell <hi>Kaine</hi> in his life, &amp; <hi>Iudas</hi> in his death, were the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of their paſſage into hell and condemnation: but it is contrary with Gods children in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, for all their afflictions are preuentions of condemnation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32. <hi>When we are iudged, wee are chaſtened of the Lord, becauſe we ſhould not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with the world</hi>: Yea, they are furtherances vnto heauen, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Our light afflictions which are but for a moment, cauſe vnto vs a farre more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and eternall waight of glory.</hi> Looke how it was with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in the red Sea; ſo it is with the wicked and the godly in their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of life and death; they were both in the Sea to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> they paſſe ſafe through it, and the Sea was as a wall to them on the right hand, and on the left, and a high way to helpe them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in their paſſage from <hi>Egypt</hi> towards <hi>Canaan</hi>; but the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were ouerwhelmed of it, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came their graue, and they ſunke to hell in it: So the ſea of all the troubles both of life and death, are
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:2715:94"/>
matters of vtter deſolation to the wicked, to further their damnation; But all that befall Gods children in this paſſage of life and death are helpes and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therances to the heauenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> matters that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their ſaluation.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt euill in theſe dangers is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenging <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> wrath of God, and this is the euil of all euils, &amp; the true cauſe of all the former, when God afflicts the wicked, hee doth it to bee reuenged of them for their ſins, as a wrathfull Iudge; But when he afflicts his children, if it be in anger, it is a fatherly anger, and indeed it is rather a fatherly loue, and a ſigne of his fauour, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6. <hi>Whom the Lord loueth, he chaſteneth, &amp;c. Iere.</hi> 10.24. <hi>Oh Lord correct me, but in iudgement, not in thine anger:</hi> God corrects his children, but he doth it not in anger &amp; fury; no, that is for the wicked. Lay all theſe together; Firſt, the children of God in all their troubles looſe no grace; no, they are gayners by them; ſecondly, they do not harden their hearts in ſin; no, their hearts are mollified by them: thirdly, their afflictions are not furtherances to hell, but they further them to heauen: Laſtly, they come not as the reuenging hand of God in fury vpon them, but in loue, as a father corrects his child; and then ſee and ſay, <hi>Oh how ſafe are all Gods children in all their dangers both of life and death</hi>? So that we ſee the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is cleare, that all true beleeuers are in good ſafety vnder Gods aſſured protection againſt all dangers of life and death.</p>
               <p>For proofe of this point;<note place="margin">Proofes.</note> firſt conſider life and death together, and then conſider them aſunder, and we ſhall find this to be true: conſider them together
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:2715:95"/>
as <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.8. <hi>Whether we liue, wee liue vnto the Lord, or whether we die, we die vnto the Lord, whether wee liue therefore or die, we are the Lords:</hi> The perſons there ſpoken of are true beleeuers, <hi>wee,</hi> and there are two things affirmed of them: Firſt, their duty to God; ſecondly, Gods protection ouer them: their duty to God in the former part of the verſe, in life and death; <hi>whether we liue,</hi> that is for the time of our life, <hi>we liue vnto God</hi>; that is, we conſecrate our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and ſoules, our liues and all our endeauours to Gods ſeruice, and to his glory: <hi>or whether wee die,</hi> that is for our ſtate in death, <hi>we die vnto the Lord</hi>: that is, we conſecrate and offer vp our ſoules and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies a holy Sacrifice to God: Then ſecondly, Gods protection ouer them, in the end of the verſe, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we liue or dye, we are the Lords: whether wee liue,</hi> that is for our eſtate in life, <hi>we are the Lords</hi>; that is, the Lord protects vs. keepes vs, and preſerues vs in all dangers; <hi>or whether we die,</hi> that is for our ſtate in death, the Lord comforts vs, ſaues vs, and deliuers vs out of all dangers and euils that by death are threatned vnto vs: ſo thou be a true beleeuer, and labour to liue and die in obedience to God, and then ſurely whether thou liueſt or dyeſt thou art the Lords, he will protect, preſerue and ſaue thee in all dangers of life and death, which is as much to ſay, that all true beleeuers are in good ſafety, &amp;c. As in the Doctrine. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.23.24. The Prophet makes it his owne particular, ſpeaking to the Lord in the ſweet meditation of his ſoule; <hi>I was alway with thee, thou haſt holden me by my right hand, thou wilt guide me by thy Councell, and afterward receiue me to glory: I
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:2715:95"/>
was alwayes with thee,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, then he was euer in true ſafety, <hi>Thou haſt holden mee by my right hand</hi>; therefore alwayes protected by God in all dangers; here is intire ſafety: yea, but that is for the time paſt; but what ſhall be for the time to come? All ſafety too, for his whole life; <hi>thou will guide mee with thy Councell,</hi> thy counſell ſhall free me from all dangers, &amp; preſerue me in dangers, &amp; carry me ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through all my dangers, that is for the ſtate of my life: but what ſhall become of vs at death? All ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty too; euen to death, &amp; in death, and after death; yea, more then ſafety, euen ſafety in glory, <hi>and afterward receiue me to glory. Phil.</hi> 1.20. <hi>I am confident</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that the Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſhall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life or by death: Paul</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it to his particular, he is confident of his ſafety, whatſoeuer comes that Chriſt ſhall be magnified in his body, &amp;c. And how ſhall Chriſt be magnified in his body in life and death? why, in life by his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold deliuerances from the manifold dangers of life; and in death, by his full deliuerance from all euils and dangers of life and death.</p>
               <p>Conſider life and death aſunder; firſt in life, Gods children are in full ſafety vnder Gods protection all their life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.9. Our feete are ſubiect to many ſlippings and ſlidings, whileſt we walke here in this world, euen all our lifetime: yea, but ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>God holdeth our ſoules in life, and ſuffereth not our feete to ſlip</hi>: that is, God holds vs ſo, as that wee ſhall not fall away from his loue in Chriſt. Secondly, in death, they are in ſafety too, vnder Gods protection, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.15. <hi>Pretious in the ſight of the Lord is the

death of his Saints.</hi> A poore childe of God lies vpon his death-bed, and bemoanes himſelfe, his friends al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo greeue for him; in the ſight of the world, he is in a greeuous and miſerable ſtate; yea, but in the ſight and eſtimation of God, his death is very pretious and deare, the Lord loues him, the Lord comforts him, and at his death the Lord receiues his ſoule as a pretious Iewell into his owne boſome, his death is pretious to the Lord, it ſeperates the vile from the holy; death ſeperates him from his foule ſinnes, and from his filthy corruptions, and from his vncleane fleſh, and from the wicked world, a pretious ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but it neuer ſeperates him from the loue of God in <hi>Chriſt Ieſus our Lord</hi>; no, it is ſo farre from that, as God eſteemes his children more pretious in their death, then in their life.</p>

I ſay, he is the Lord of life and death, and they are his ſeruants, and they can doe nothing but what God will haue them to doe; and therefore except God himſelfe will hurt vs; theſe can neuer hurt vs, nor put vs out of his ſafty; yea, further ſeeing the Lord himſelfe loues vs, and protects vs, life and death, being his ſeruants,

ſhall be applyed and diſpoſed of for the ſeruice of our ſafety and protection. God is not gouerned by our ſtate &amp; condition either in life or death, but our ſtate both in life &amp; death is altogether ouer-ruled by God, &amp; framed according to his owne will, ſo that his will being to doe vs good, life and death therfore and our whole ſtate in them muſt be anſwerable therunto.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Miniſtry of Gods Angells, that is <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> another reaſon of it, for both in life, and in death we are vnder the cuſtody of the Angells, and that by Gods appointment, as hee being the Prince of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, God giues <hi>his Angels charge ouer vs</hi> to keepe vs in ſafety both in life and death, and that is the true reaſon of our ſafety, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.10, 11. The Angels keepe vs, and that vniuerſally <hi>in all our wayes</hi>; they keepe vs, and that very charily and tenderly; <hi>they beare vs in their hands,</hi> and they keepe vs very ſafely and ſurely, ſo <hi>that we daſh not our foot againſt a ſtone.</hi> Now the protection of the Angels is Gods own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, becauſe it is by his appointment, and therfore aſcribe it not to the Creature, it is due to the Creator, bleſſe God for it. The Angels doe many good offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for vs, they waite on vs, they deſtroy our enemies, they comfort vs in our diſtreſſes and troubles; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue al they guard our perſons in the time of our life, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 34.7. <hi>The Angel of the Lord pitcheth his Tents round about them that feare him &amp; deliuereth them:</hi> And they guard our ſoules at the time of our death, and carry them <hi>into Abrahams boſome,</hi> as they did the ſoule of <hi>Lazarus, Luk.</hi> 16.22.

In this corrupt ſtate life is as a Snake, and death is as a Serpent, full of poyſon in themſelues, and we are in danger to bee ſtung and poyſoned by them: but Chriſt Ieſus by his life and by his death hath taken away the poyſon of our life, and the ſting of our death, that is ſinne, and ſo wee are now in ſafety a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the dangers both of life and death, there is no hurt in them.

               <p>Thirdly, We muſt grow to ſome familiar acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> with the life and death of Ieſus Chriſt feelingly and ſauingly, not onely as hee liuing and dying in himſelfe, but as hee liuing and dying for thee, and thou liuing and dying in him. If once we can me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate ſoundly on the life of Chriſt, apply our ſelues vnto it, it will ſweeten our life; and ſo, if we can me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate ſoundly and rightly on his death, and apply it to our ſelues, it will ſweeten our death: For this is the patterne that we muſt conforme our ſelues vnto, both in Gods intendment, and in our owne practiſe. Looke how the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> did <hi>ſpread himſelfe on the Child,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.34. <hi>and laid his mouth to the childes mouth, &amp;c.</hi> ſo doth Chriſt ſpreade himſelfe vpon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery true beleeuer that rightly apprehends him, hee ſtretcheth himſelfe vpon vs in euery particular, hee layes his mouth vpon our mouth, his eyes vpon our eyes, and his hands vpon our hands, &amp;c. to ſanctifie vs, and to preſerue vs in them; he layes his particular
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:2715:100"/>
temptations and ſufferings on ours, to ſanctifie and preſerue vs in ours; his life on our life, to ſanctifie and preſerue vs in the ſtate of life; and his death on our death to ſanctifie and preſerue vs in our ſtate of death. This is a ſingular comfort to a poore ſoule, to apply Chriſts life and death to himſelfe: I ſay, it is a ſound comfort to them both in life and death; but this is a myſtery, euery one is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Laſtly, Let vs make application before-hand, of the comforts of God againſt the dangers which we are ſubiect to, not in generall onely, but in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: It is our skill to apply particular comforts to particular dangers, and troubles. Is it matter of life that doth endanger vs? Doe the comforts of life draw vs from God? Let vs conſider, that they are but for the outward man, and that they are our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; and ſhall wee make much of an enemy, and preferre their well-fare before our owne? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, conſider they are not permanent, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant and tranſitory, they endure but for a time, and for a ſhort time: They are like to <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> gourd, that came vp in a night, and periſhed in a night; and wilt thou ſet thy heart vpon that which is nothing? Riches haue winges and flye away, they are quickely gone, and ſo are honours, and the like, and wilt thou ſet thy heart vpon ſuch tranſitory things? Thirdly, conſider that all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts are mingled with many ſorrowes, euery ſweet pleaſure and worldly comfort hath his ſower paine and diſcomfort; though they be pleaſant for the time, yet they are ſowre and bitter in the end.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:2715:100"/>
Laſtly, let vs conſider that the comforts of grace are incomparably greater and better and more excellent then all outward comforts, there is no ſorrow in them, they will make thee truely happy and bleſſed; and wilt thou preferre the ſhadow before the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance? Yea, but will ſome ſay, My croſſes and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions they perplexe and trouble me, and make mee vnfit to ſerue God. I anſwere, That is thy fault; why ſhould croſſes hinder thee, or diſable thee for the ſeruice of God? Stil apply Gods comforts to thy croſſes; firſt the croſſes are but ſhort, though they be ſharpe; and wilt thou not endure a while, for a time? ſecondly, they are light and momentary, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. Thirdly, they are nothing in compariſon either of the paines of hell, which wee muſt endure hereafter, if we will not endure the croſſe here; or of the glory of heauen which wee ſhall bee ſure to haue, if we endure afflictions patiently, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. <hi>I account that the afflictions of this preſent time, are not worthy of the glory that ſhal be ſhewed to vs.</hi> And again, wee haue many times of comforts mixed with the dayes of affliction, and this may keepe vs to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God in our liues. Yea, but what ſhall we doe in death? that is the end of all: ſhall I deſire it to rid me out of all my troubles? I anſwere; no, thy times are in Gods hands, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.15. and not in thine owne; but if thou deſireſt death, that thou maiſt be with Chriſt, it is well; but if it be for worldly diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, it is deſperate and damnable. What then, ſhall I feare it? wee know that the very name of death is fearefull vnto vs. I anſwere, that it is onely thy owne feare, there is no more feare in death, then
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:2715:101"/>
in any other thing, we make it fearefull to our ſelues. It is but the withdrawing hand of God; if we feare it, it is becauſe wee are wicked, for, <hi>the righteous haue hope in their death, Prou.</hi> 14.32. <hi>But what hope hath the wicked, if God take away his ſoule, Iob</hi> 27.8. Yea, but the time of my death, that feares mee; I would bee richer, and I would be better before I die, it is yet too ſoone to die: I anſwere, this is thy peruerſe iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but whatſoeuer thou thinkeſt, certainely God neuer takes away any of his children but in due time, howſoeuer it ſeeme vntimely to vs, <hi>Iob</hi> 5.26. <hi>Thou ſhalt goe to thy graue in a full age, as a Ricke of Corne commeth in due ſeaſon into the Barne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo the kinde of death that feares me; happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it may be cruell or reproachfull by warre or the like. I anſwere, it is all one howſoeuer it be, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be worſe then thy Sauiours, and why ſhould it diſmay thee? It is the ſame hand of God, and hee is there preſent with thee to receiue thy ſoule. Yea, but death is bitter: But Chriſt Ieſus hath looſed the ſorrowes of death, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.24. and that not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe only, but for vs alſo, yea he hath ſweetned them by his victory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.54. Laſtly, the conſequents of death they are the worſt &amp; moſt fearefull, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the graue, and corruption, &amp;c. I anſwere, againſt iudgement, thou muſt get faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and againſt corruption and the graue, thou muſt beleeue that God will raiſe thy body vp againe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.10. And ſo for thy ſoule thou muſt commit it into the hand of God, it is deare and pretious vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: Haſt thou ſerued the Lord with thy ſoule all thy life, and art thou afraid to truſt him with it at
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:2715:101"/>
thy death? We are apt to ſuſpect what ſhall become of our ſoules at our death: Let vs looke vpon Chriſt Ieſus, conſider what became of his ſoule at his death, it went into <hi>Paradiſe</hi> into <hi>Heauen</hi>: And what for himſelfe alone? no, but for vs, yea meerely for vs; ſo that the children of God are as ſure of it, as Chriſt himſelf. Thus let vs comfort our ſelues with the application of Gods particular promiſes againſt our particular troubles: and both in life and death let vs apply our ſelues vnderſtandingly, and feelingly vnto God, and ſo ſhall we be ſafe vnder his protection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all dangers both in life and death.</p>

For the meaning of theſe three words, I confeſſe that there is great hardneſſe in them, and great difficulty amongſt interpreters about them; I will not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you with many expoſitions, generally the words are expounded altogether of Angels and nothing elſe, but herein ſome ſpeake more boldly, ſome more modeſtly: They that ſpeake more boldly take it thus; by <hi>Angels,</hi> they vnderſtand the whole Army of Gods Angels in generall, and by <hi>Rulers and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> they vnderſtand certaine diſtinct orders of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels one aboue another: But this though it be the iudgement of many of the learned, yet it is a meere coniecture; for there is no certainety ſet downe in Gods word, what be the diſtinct order of <hi>Angels</hi>; and for a man to take vpon him to ſpeake of ſuch high myſteries as theſe are without warrant from Gods Word, is great preſumption: They that ſpeake more modeſtly, doe vnderſtand by all theſe three words, <hi>Angels, Rulers and Powers,</hi> one and the ſame thing, that is, all the Angels indifferently: But why doth the Apoſtle here giue them ſeuerall names?
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:2715:103"/>
they anſwere that hee doth it in three ſeuerall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects: They are called Angels in reſpect of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: they are meſſengers: ſecondly, they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Rulers, in reſpect of the excellency of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and Powers in reſpect of their mightineſſe and ſtrength. This expoſition comes neereſt the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles meaning, and it containes nothing in it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the rule of faith, nor againſt the vſe of the words, nor againſt the drift and ſcope of the place, &amp;c. Yet it comes ſhort of the Apoſtles ſtraine, and doth not reach the full meaning of the place; for the Apoſtle here, in the height of his ſpirit, makes a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall challenge againſt all liuing mighty workers in the world vnder God, that they ſhall neuer impeach the ſafety of Gods children in the ſtate of grace; therefore the words muſt be expounded, that they may comprehend all ſuch agents whatſoeuer: Now there are other mighty liuing workers beſides the Angels; therefore ſauing the iudgement of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter learned, we expound it thus: By <hi>Angels</hi> we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand all the Angels that are, as well thoſe that ſtand, as thoſe that are fallen, as well good as bad; for ſo the word naturally ſignifies: For, when the Scripture ſpeakes of good Angels onely, it cals them holy Angels, Elect Angels, mighty Angels, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God, &amp;c. but here it ſpeakes of Angels in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and therefore we are to vnderſtand it both of good and bad. By Rulers or Principalities, wee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand earthly Gouernours, the great and mighty Monarches and Magiſtrates of the earth, Kings, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, and the like; for ſo this word, in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, is expreſly confined to this ſence in two places
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:2715:103"/>
of the Scripture, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.11. <hi>And when they bring you vnto the Sinagogues, and vnto Rulers, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Titus</hi> 3.1. <hi>Put them in minde that they be ſubiect to Principalities or Rulers.</hi> It is true that the ſame word is ſometimes in the Scripture meant of the Angels both good and bad, but the Apoſtle hauing mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them already in the former words, there is no need that it ſhould be meant of them in this word too. Thirdly, by <hi>powers</hi> vnderſtand all the gifts and enablements that either theſe or any other mighty workers in the world are furniſhed withall, as autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, place, ſtrength, wit, policy, &amp;c. for ſo the word in the originall vſually ſignifies, not ſo much the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents themſelues, as the powers and enablements whereby they do worke; ſo that lay all theſe briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together, and then the meaning of the words are thus much, as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, I am ſure that neither all the Angels, good nor bad, nor all the Rulers and Potentates, Monarches and Magiſtrates of the world; nor all the powers or enablements that theſe or any other are furniſhed withall, ſhall euer be able to <hi>ſeperate me from the loue of God which is in Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Here is a high ſtraine of aſſurance; and wee muſt haue a great meaſure of faith to attaine vnto it.</p>
               <p>The Doctrine that ariſeth naturally out of the whole ſtate of the words thus vnfolded is this:<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> namely, That howſoeuer it be that Angels both good and bad, and Rulers, great Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, Potentates and Monarches of the world, are mighty workers, endued with great powers, gifts, and enablements; yet neither Angels good nor bad, nor
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:2715:104"/>
all the Rulers and Potentates in the world, endued with all their powers, gifts, and enablements, ſhall neuer be able to ſeperate true beleuers from the loue of God which is in <hi>Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To auoide confuſion we will handle the three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall branches of the Doctrine,<note place="margin">The firſt branch of the Doctrine.</note> euery one apart; we will firſt begin with good Angels, and then wee muſt apply the Doctrine thus: That howſoeuer the good Angels are mighty workers, great in power and enablements, yet neither they, nor all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they haue, ſhall be euer able to <hi>ſeperate vs from the loue of God which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.</hi> For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this point,<note place="margin">Explication in the opening of three parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</note> wee are here to touch theſe three particulars, as neceſſary for the vnderſtanding of this Doctrine: Firſt, what theſe good Angels are: Secondly, what is that Relation and Communion that is betwixt them and true beleeuers: Thirdly, what dangers they are that may befall true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers by good Angels.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For the firſt, what good Angels are: Good Angels are certaine ſpirituall ſubſtances, that kept their firſt eſtate, and are immediate and continuall attendants before the preſence of God: that they are ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, their actions prooue it, they reioyce, worſhip God, paſſe from place to place, and performe ſundry actions, and actions are neuer performed but by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: that they are ſpirituall ſubſtances, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tels vs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.7. <hi>He maketh his Angels Spirits</hi>: that they kept their firſt eſtate the Apoſtle <hi>Iude</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, <hi>verſe</hi> 6. when he ſaith of the euill angels, <hi>That they kept not their firſt eſtate,</hi> thereby neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying by oppoſition, that the good Angels haue
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:2715:104"/>
kept their firſt eſtate, that is, the bleſſed eſtate of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency that God created them in. Laſtly, that they are immediate and continuall attendants before God; <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaw it in a viſion, <hi>Dan</hi> 7.10. <hi>The anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of dayes ſate vpon a throne</hi>; and who were his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants? the Angels, <hi>Thouſands thouſands miniſtred vnto him, and ten thouſand times ten thouſand ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</hi> So we ſee what the good Angels be: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things might be ſaid of them, but I touch theſe onely, which of neceſſity we muſt know for the vnderſtanding of the Doctrine in hand.</p>
               <p>The ſecond particular is, what this relation and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Communion is, that is betwixt good Angels and true Beleeuers? Surely it is a neere relation and heauenly Communion; they and we are fellow-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, as worſhipping and ſeruing one and the ſame God. The Angell himſelfe auoucheth it, <hi>Reu.</hi> 19.10. <hi>I am thy fellow-ſeruant</hi>: They and wee are brethren in the teſtimony of Ieſus, as the ſame Angel affirmeth in the words following: They and wee are fellow-Citizens <hi>of the heauenly Ieruſalem, Heb.</hi> 12.22. Wee are their charge, they are our guard and keepers; <hi>They pitch their Tents round about vs for our ſafegard and protection, Pſal.</hi> 34.7. They are our patterne, we are their reſemblance, both for obedience whileſt we liue here, <hi>Math.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Thy will be done in earth as it is in heauen.</hi> and likewiſe for glory hereafter, <hi>Luk.</hi> 20.36. Other bonds there are whereby they are aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to vs, and we to them, but theſe are the neereſt and chiefeſt, and moſt remarkeable.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt poynt is, what thoſe dangers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> are that may befall true beleeuers by the good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels?
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:2715:105"/>
To this I anſwere, two things; Firſt, that the Apoſtle doth not ſay here directly, that the good Angels of themſelues may endanger Gods Children, but he ſpeakes it here by way of ſuppoſition, as if he ſhould ſay, ſuppoſe that they ſhould endanger Gods children, yet they could <hi>neuer ſeparate them from the loue of God.</hi> And this is very obſeruable in the whole tenour of the Apoſtles ſpeech, that all the dangers which he mentions are put downe by way of ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, but ſafety and the comforts againſt them, are ſet downe poſitiuely and directly; As if hee ſhould ſay, ſuppoſe that the good Angels ſhould endanger vs, yet certainely they ſhould neuer <hi>ſeparate vs from the loue of God</hi>: But eſpecially it is to be marked in this particular concerning the good Angels, for this is meerely a ſuppoſall, that the good Angels of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſhould hurt vs. But, why then doth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle mention any ſuch matter here? I anſwere, for the further confirmation of true beleeuers in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of Gods loue. I will cleare this place by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place of the Apoſtle in the very like kinde, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6. <hi>If an Angell from heauen preach any other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, &amp;c.</hi> Will any man conclude from hence, that therefore an Angell from heauen may, or can preach any other Goſpell then <hi>Paul</hi> had preached? No, but the Apoſtle ſpeaks it by way of ſuppoſall onely, and ſuppoſalls doe not affirme any thing in being: Yea, but why doth the Apoſtle then here vſe the name of an holy Angell in this caſe? I anſwere, he had good reaſon for it, that he might confirme them the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the truth which hee had taught, namely, that we muſt be ſo ſtedfaſtly ſetled in the faith of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:2715:105"/>
of Chriſt, that if an Angell from heauen ſhould teach any other Doctrine (which is a thing impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) yet if he ſhould we muſt defie him, and hold him accurſed. And ſo the Apoſtle in this place makes the eſtate of Gods children ſo ſure and firme, that if the good Angels ſhould ſet themſelues againſt them, to <hi>ſeparate them from the loue of God in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> (which is impoſſible) but if they ſhould, yet they could not doe it. Secondly, I anſwere, that howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they doe not of themſelues endanger vs, yet oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally in regard of our weakneſſe and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they may endanger vs: We may in our weaknes abuſe them, or miſtake their ſeruice, or put our truſt in them, and ſo indanger our ſelues greatly by them. I will giue you a plaine inſtance in the holy Apoſtle S. <hi>Iohn, Reuel.</hi> 19.10. and <hi>Reuel.</hi> 22.8. he was a true beleeuer, yet in his weakneſſe, by occaſion of a good Angell, he was in danger to commit a vile and moſt fearefull ſinne, the very ſinne of Idolatry, and that not once, but twiſe, and that though he were repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for it: A grieuous ſinne; but the Angell he hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders him, <hi>See thou doe it not,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>worſhip not mee, worſhip God:</hi> In which we may obſerue two things that doe effectually concerne the poynt in hand; firſt, that true beleeuers may, through their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and weakeneſſe, be indangered in the eſtate of grace by the good Angels; yet ſecondly, that God will neuer ſuffer them to be ouercome and ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp of this, it ſhall neuer preuaile vtterly to <hi>ſeparate them from the loue of God which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo now the Doctrine being thus cleared, wee
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:2715:106"/>
come to the proofes,<note place="margin">Proofes.</note> which are theſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.10. <hi>See that ye deſpiſe not one of theſe little ones, for I ſay vnto you, that in heauen their Angels alwaies behold the face of my Father which is in heauen.</hi> Theſe words are the words of our Sauiour, and he ownes them by a ſpeciall challenge, <hi>I ſay vnto you</hi>; I that know well what belongs to God, and to Gods Angels, and to Gods little ones, I ſay vnto you, <hi>deſpiſe not one of theſe little ones, for in heauen their Angels alwaies behold the face of my Father which is in heauen.</hi> The matter affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med there is the continuall attendance of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in the preſence of God; but the drift of the ſpeech is, to note the continuall care that the Angels of God haue ouer Gods weake children, as appeares, firſt by their title, <hi>their Angels</hi>; they are Gods Angels, as he being their Lord and Maſter to whom they doe belong, and they be our Angels, as we being the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of that their Lord and Maſter, and in reſpect of the care and charge that they are imployed in about vs. Secondly, it appeares by the forme of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>See</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour) <hi>you deſpiſe not one of Gods weake children, ſee that you hurt them not; for I ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you</hi>; as who ſhould ſay, doe not deſpiſe them, nor hurt them, for if you doe, ſurely their Angels will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge the wrong and hurt done to them. Thirdly, by the time, <hi>alwayes,</hi> this is not for a day, nor a yeare, but <hi>alwayes,</hi> without ceaſing: put all theſe together, and the Doctrine is here clearely proued, that the Angels of God are ours, they are for vs, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, they will be auenged on thoſe that hurt vs, and therefore will neuer hurt vs themſelues; and this is their care &amp; practiſe always, they are euer imploide
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:2715:106"/>
about our good, and therefore <hi>they ſhall neuer ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate vs</hi> from our greateſt good of all, <hi>from the loue of God in Chriſt Ieſus, Heb.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Are they not all mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring ſpirits, ſent forth to miniſter for their ſakes that ſhall be heires of ſaluation?</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeakes here generally of all good Angels, <hi>Are they not all?</hi> and doth not diuide them in office or nature, but ioynes them in both, they are all <hi>ſpirits</hi> by nature: And what are they by office? They are all <hi>miniſtring ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> and what miniſtry is it that they are imploied in? <hi>ſent forth, &amp;c.</hi> God ſends them forth from time to time to performe certaine offices about his children, and his heires, as a father makes his ſeruants to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him that ſhall be his heire: and they are ſent forth to miniſter for <hi>their ſakes</hi> that ſhall be heires of ſaluation. They are moſt dutifull attendants on vs that are heires, and they miniſter for our <hi>ſakes,</hi> that is, for our good, comfort, and protection onely, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer for our hurt; they know from God that wee are appointed to ſaluation, and ſhall they at any time hinder vs of it? They take notice of it that wee are heires to their Lord and Maſter, and ſhall they being ſeruants, goe about to hinder vs of the inheritance which their Lord and Maſter, and our Father hath appointed to vs? No ſurely, they will not doe it; but on the contrary, they will helpe and further vs all they can thereunto, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.11, 12. <hi>Hee ſhall giue his Angels charge ouer thee, to keepe thee in all thy wayes, &amp;c.</hi> God hath committed his children to the charge and cuſtody of his Angels; What to doe? to <hi>keepe them,</hi> not to deſtroy them, and to keepe them in <hi>all their wayes</hi>; they ſhall not faile them in
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:2715:107"/>
any one paſſage of their life, <hi>to beare vs vp in their hands,</hi> neuer to ſuffer vs to fall vtterly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, much leſſe to cauſe vs ſo to fall, <hi>that thou daſh not thy foot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a ſtone</hi>: They ſhall preſerue vs from the harmes that our ſelues or others might do vnto vs, therefore themſelues ſhall neuer hurt vs in the leaſt kind, much leſſe in the matter of grace and ſaluation: A place ſo pregnant to prooue the infallible protection of Gods children by the Angels, that the Diuell himſelfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth it for a certaine truth, and alleageth it for that purpoſe, <hi>Math.</hi> 4.6. Laſtly, their practiſe makes this good by experience, what good offices haue they done from time to time for Gods children? preſerued them from their enemies, as <hi>Lot, Gen.</hi> 19.10. deliuered them out of priſon, as <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 12. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted them in their diſtreſſes, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.23, 24. freed them in their troubles, as the <hi>Iſraelites, Iſay</hi> 65.9. ſhewed them, and directed them what they muſt doe to be ſaued, as <hi>Cornelius, Acts</hi> 10.5. In a word, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite are the good offices that the good Angels haue done for Gods children, but there is not one place extant in all Gods word, to prooue that any good Angel hath done any harme to any one of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: No, that is for the euill Angels to hurt vs, they hurt vs altogether, and neuer doe vs the leaſt good; but the good Angels they helpe vs alwayes, they are altogether and onely to helpe vs, and neuer to doe vs the leaſt harme, and therefore they with all the power they haue can <hi>neuer ſeparate vs from the loue of God which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.</hi>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> The reaſons of this poynt may be reduced to theſe two heads. Firſt, the good Angels will not hinder
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:2715:107"/>
our ſaluation, if they could: Secondly, they cannot doe it, if they would. Firſt, they will not doe it if they could; for there are foure ingagements whereby the will of the Angels is ſo ſtirred and inclined towards vs, as that they will neuer hurt vs, if they could; firſt, the zeale of Gods glory: Secondly, obedience to Gods will: Thirdly, their dependance on Ieſus Chriſt: And fourthly, their communion they haue with vs. Firſt, the zeale of Gods glory, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.2. they are <hi>Seraphims,</hi> that is, hot and fiery ſpirits, burning not in fury, but in zeale for the glory of the Lord of hoaſts. Now they know that God is wonderfully glorified in the ſaluation of his children, and therfore they will not hinder that at any hand, but zealouſly aduance it to the vttermoſt of their power. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their obedience to Gods will, they know it is Gods will to giue his children a kingdome, and will they croſſe his will? No, they obey and doe his will, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.20. they will neuer croſſe it. They know their fellow-Angels fruſtrated their eſtate by diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and will they fruſtrate theirs too? Noe, they will not. Thirdly, their dependance on Chriſt, and their loue to him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.51. <hi>Hereafter you ſhall ſee hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen open, and the Angells of God aſcending and deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon that Sonne of man</hi>: All their miniſtry is from God to vs, as in Chriſt, and they are vpheld by Chriſt, or elſe they are as changeable as the euill An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells were by nature, and they know that Chriſt hath redeemed vs with his pretious bloud, and will they ſeeke to caſt away the price of his bloud? They know that Chriſt hath committed vs to God his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and will they incenſe vs againſt God, or God
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:2715:108"/>
againſt vs? Laſtly, their faithfulneſſe to vs, and their communion with vs, they take notice of vs as their fellow-ſeruants, and therefore they will not hurt vs, hee is an euill ſeruant that will ſmite his fellow-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants; this is odious on earth, how much more in heauen; if euer the holy Angels ſhould entertain any faithleſſe or treacherous thought againſt vs, their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes and brethren, heauen they know would neuer endure them.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> The ſecond reaſon: The Angels cannot doe it if they would; &amp; this agrees more fitly with the words of the Apoſtle, that <hi>they ſhall not be able to ſeparate vs.</hi> There are two vnmoueable barres whereby they are vtterly diſabled from hurting vs in eſtate of grace: The firſt is the ſoueraign power &amp; ouer-ruling hand of God; the ſecond, is the neerneſſe of our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt. Firſt, the ſoueraigne power of God and his ouer-ruling hand both ouer them &amp; vs, that hinders them; they are Gods elect Angels, and we are Gods elect children, and therefore God by bis ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne power, will neuer ſuffer them to ſeduce vs, nor ſuffer vs to be ſeduced by them, Gods election muſt ſtand good for euer. Secondly, the neereneſſe of our vnion with Chriſt, that is another bar to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them: Chriſt tooke our nature vpon him, not the Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. and herein we are a degree aboue the Angels. Now this aſſumption of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into the perſon of Chriſt, and his participation with vs therein is ſo ſanctified, and effectually rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith, and by the ſpirit, to euery true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that they are truely one with Chriſt himſelfe; and can the Angels hurt Chriſt? or betray Chriſt?
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:2715:108"/>
or ſeparate Chriſt from Gods loue? then neither can they hurt vs, nor betray vs, <hi>nor ſeparate vs from the loue of God in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Vſes are theſe: Firſt, ſince it is ſo, that the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſes </seg>1</label> good Angels can neuer impeach the eſtate of Gods children, therefore it ſhewes that whoſoeuer they be that doe fall away from the eſtate of grace by the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of good Angels, that certainly they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer true beleeuers: ſuch there were in the time of the Apoſtles, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.18. That vnder a colour of Religion and humbleneſſe of minde did worſhip Angels, ſuch as the Monkes and Fryars bee at this day; but what ſaith the Apoſtle in the 19. <hi>verſe</hi>? They that teach ſuch things <hi>hold not the head</hi>; that is, they hold not Chriſt as their head, they are vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly voyde of Chriſt, and ſo liuing and dying in that ſinne, they are vtterly void of the ſtate of grace, and ſaluation. This ſets ſuch a brand of reprobation on the Popiſh Church and Religion, that they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer able to claw it off: They hold many other groſſe points, which at leaſt by conſequence ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the foundation <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi>: But of this point the Apoſtle ſaith directly, <hi>That they that hold it, hold not the head Chriſt.</hi> A man cannot be a worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Angels and belong to Chriſt. And doth not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> greatly adore and worſhip An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels? doe they not reuerence them, and call vpon them? It is their profeſſed Doctrine and ordinary practiſe: I would faine ſee how they would anſwere this; they are cut off hereby from the head <hi>Chriſt</hi>: I doubt not but many of them are the Elect of God, but then either the Lord keepes them that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:2715:109"/>
they fall into this ſinne; or if they doe fall into it, yet God giues them repentance for it before they die, that lo they ſhall not fall by it for euer.

               <p>The third Vſe teacheth vs, the infinite and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſes </seg>3</label> power of ſauing grace; It is infinitely greater then all the powers that are to be found in the eſtate of nature, Gods ſauing grace is infinitely of more power to ſaue vs, then all the powers in the world are to deſtroy vs: Of all other creatures the Angels excell in ſtrength and power, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.20. Yet all the ſtrength and power they haue, ſhall neuer be able to croſſe or hinder the power of grace for the ſaluation of the faithfull: this is the ſinewes of our aſſurance: Some thinke it is an eaſie matter to be ſaued: No, it is the infinite and Almighty power of God that muſt ſhew forth it ſelfe in ſauing vs, elſe it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for vs to be ſaued, 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 1.5. Without this power of God it is impoſſible that wee ſhould be

kept, there is not the leaſt ſinne forgiuen, nor the leaſt corruption ſubdued, nor the leaſt ſparkle of grace wrought in our hearts, nor the leaſt temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ouercome, but by the almighty power of ſauing grace. On the other ſide ſome diſmay themſelues at their owne corruptions, Sathans temptations, and the defections of a godly life, that they thinke it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be ſaued; here we muſt flie to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the infinite and almighty power of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing grace, and then we ſhall be ſatisfied: And take heed though thou debaſe thy ſelfe, debaſe not God: It is impoſſible with thee, but it is not impoſſible with God, for then who can be ſaued? <hi>All things are poſsible with God, Matth.</hi> 19.25.26. It is our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Reſolution in this very caſe, teaching vs to reſt wholly and onely vpon the power of God for ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; It is impoſſible with men that any ſhould bee ſaued: Yea, but it is poſſible with God by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſauing grace, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. <hi>My grace</hi> (ſaith God to the Apoſtle) <hi>is ſufficient for thee: Paul</hi> had no reſt in himſelfe before; but the almighty and all-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient grace of God gaue him full content: This is that which giues vs ſatisfaction, and makes vs goe on cheerefully againſt all difficulties, the all-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of ſauing grace.

               <p>The laſt Vſe teacheth vs how to carry our ſelues towards the good Angels, that ſo they may not hurt <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſes </seg>4</label> vs, but that we may comfortably enioy their helpe, protection, and furtherance in the way of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; this is a hard leſſon to learne and to practiſe, but yet worth our learning, and much to be deſired; and practiſed by all thoſe that would finde heauen vpon earth; It is difficult I confeſſe, but very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, for either we are too negligent or too dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in this, either we will not meddle at all with the nature &amp; office of Angels, or elſe we will meddle too much with it. If therefore we wil haue the helpe, com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fort, &amp; protection of the good Angels, wee muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue theſe rules. Firſt, keepe Gods good will,<note place="margin">How we are to carry our ſelues towards the good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that they may not hurt vs, but doe vs good.</note> keepe God thy friend; the beſt way to keepe the ſeruants to be thy friend, is to keep their maſter to be thy friend, ſo keepe God to be thy friend, and that is the beſt way to keep his ſeruants the Angels to be thy friend: All the promiſes of protection by the Angels are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to ſuch as are Gods, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.7. <hi>The Angell of the Lord campeth about them that feare him:</hi> And <hi>Pſal</hi> 91.11. <hi>He ſhall giue his Angels charge ouer thee, to keepe thee in all thy wayes</hi>; Feare God and pray vnto him as <hi>Cornelius</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.2.4. and walke dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently in the duties of thy calling, as the Shepheards did, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.8.9.10. and then the Angels will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vs, protect and keepe vs. The Angels loue vs
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:2715:111"/>
for our heauenly Fathers ſake; if we be ſtubborne to him, they will turne their loue from vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond Rule is this; we muſt hold faſt by Ieſus Chriſt; he is the common head both of them and vs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.31. and 16.27. All the good they doe vs, and all the ſeruice which they owe vs, is for Chriſt his ſake, becauſe we are in him; if he fauour vs, they will fauour vs; if he frowne on vs, they will frowne on vs too: If euer we will enioy the comfortable miniſtery of the Angels, let vs lay faſt hold on Ieſus Chriſt by faith; ſo farre as we goe from him, they goe from vs: Let vs therefore lay faſt hold on Ieſus Chriſt by faith in his bloud, by loue to his Maieſty, by obeying the motions of his Spirit, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming our ſelues to his example; and then the Angels are ready preſt to doe vs their beſt ſeruice; hold thou faſt to Chriſt, and they will be ſure to hold thee faſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, take notice of the Miniſtry of the Angels, beleeue it, and be not ignorant of it; If thou haſt beene ignorant of it, yet now take notice of it, and make vſe of it: We ſtand in need of the Miniſtery of the Angels, wee know that we are tempted many wayes, looke vpon the good Angels, they will aſſiſt thee more then the bad can hurt thee, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 12.8. <hi>Michael and his Angels fought, and the Dragon fought and his Angels:</hi> Chriſt and his Angels, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell and his Angels, they fight for our poore ſoules; But the Diuell and his Angels doe not preuaile; but Chriſt and his Angels they doe preuaile, and they are on our ſide to fight for vs. And therefore as the Prophet, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.16.17. prayed to the Lord to
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:2715:111"/>
open his ſeruants eyes, that hee might ſee that there was more with them, then againſt them: So let vs pray to God to open our eyes, that we may ſee and take notice of the Miniſtery of the good Angels, and of their protection and care ouer vs.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, let vs imitate the good Angels in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Let vs doe Gods will on earth, as the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Angels doe in heauen, Pſal.</hi> 103.20.21. They are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer out of Gods way, they euer doe Gods will wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and cheerefully; the Diuell doth Gods will too, but it is grudgingly and againſt his will. The good Angels they worſhip God, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.6. They take the cauſe of Gods children to heart, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce at the good of Gods Church and children, eſpecially at the good of their ſoules; ſo let vs wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God alone, and let the good of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, eſpecially the good of their ſoules, bee the ioy of our hearts. Let vs imitate them thus, but yet let vs beware of <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Fiftly, ſpeake not euill of thoſe that are in place <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and dignity, for the Angels <hi>giue not railing ſpeeches,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10.11. The Angels doe it not, let vs take heed we doe it not.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, offend not theſe Angels, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.10. <hi>The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> woman ought to couer her head, becauſe of the Angels.</hi> The Angels are about vs, &amp; obſerue our doings, and marke our carriage, if it be reuerent and agreeable to our profeſſion, they reioyce at it; if wee miſ-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue our ſelues and carry our ſelues vnreuerently in our words, geſtures, or apparell, miſ-beſeeming our perſons, places, or profeſſion, this offends and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:2715:112"/>
greeues them, they diſtaſte it, and are diſpleaſed at it, let vs take heed therefore that we offend them not.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seauenthly, let vs not worſhip them in any caſe, for that is the way to incenſe them againſt vs. In the <hi>Reuel.</hi> 19.10. and 22.8. when <hi>Iohn</hi> would haue wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the Angell, <hi>Hee was angry, ſee thou doe it not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>worſhip God.</hi> It is an horrible diſhonor to God, and much diſpleaſing to the good Angels themſelues, they tremble at it, and abhorre it: Away with it ſaith the Angell, worſhip not me, worſhip God: Which is worſe the Thiefe or the Receiuer? If I worſhip the Angels, I am the thiefe, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and accept of it, they are the receiuers, but they abhorre it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Laſtly, let vs glorifie God for the Miniſtery of the good Angels; the ſhepherds in <hi>Lu.</hi> 2.20. hauing heard many good things from the miniſtery of the Angels, they returned glorifying, &amp; praiſing not the Angels, but God for their Miniſtery: Take the benefit of it, and giue the Angels due reuerence and reſpect for their Miniſtery, but giue the honour &amp; glory of it to God alone; thus did <hi>Daniel, Chap.</hi> 6.22. and <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 12.11. they doe not aſcribe their deliuerance to the Angell, but to God that ſent his Angell, and yet they doe reuerently mention the Angell, that was the meanes of it: And we haue great cauſe to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God for their Miniſtery; for firſt it is a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to vs: what greater comfort can we haue by any of the creatures, then to haue thouſand thouſands of Angels, the beſt and greateſt of Gods creatures euermore to attend on vs? Secondly, it is a great honor to vs, the greateſt honor God that can beſtow
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:2715:112"/>
vpon vs by any of the Creatures, that the Angels that are farre more excellent Creatures by creation then our ſelues, ſhould be attendants on vs: Oh, let vs honor God greatly, that hath ſo greatly hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vs. Thirdly, all the good they doe vnto vs, they doe it but as inſtruments, it is God alone that is the authour of it; therefore let God alone haue all the glory and honour of it. Obſerue theſe rules careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and conſcionably, and I will aſſure thee from God, that thou ſhalt be made partaker of the comfort and protection of the good Angels, they ſhall attend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee all thy life, to preſerue thee from euill, and to incourage thee to goodneſſe, and to comfort thee in troubles, and to helpe thee out of them; and at thy death they ſhall ſtand by thee to cheere thee vp againſt the bitterneſſe and terrour of thy diſſolution, and to carry thy ſoule into heauen. And yet this is not all, for behold yet further, at the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they ſhall ſummon thy body out of the graue, and place thee amongſt the ſheepe at Gods right hand, that there thou mayeſt receiue that ioyfull and bleſſed ſentence, <hi>Come ye bleſſed, inherite the kingdome prepared for you from the beginning of the world,</hi> ſuch honour haue all Gods Saints.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Apoſtle here, when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the dangers that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the faithfull, and the comforts againſt them; hee ſets them before vs in certaine rankes and orders. And the firſt ranke is the dangers that come to vs by death, and by life, and the comforts againſt them, and of that wee haue ſpoken.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ranke is, of the dangers that come to vs by Angels, Rulers, and powers, and that we haue entred into, and ſhewed that by Angels are meant all ſorts of Angels, both good and bad, both thoſe that ſtand, and thoſe that are fallen. Of the good Angels we haue ſpoken as it pleaſed God to giue abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Now we are to ſpeake of the euill Angels, that the euill Angels <hi>ſhall neuer be able to ſeparate vs from the loue of God which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.</hi> That the euill Angels muſt needs be here meant appeares, becauſe they are generally comprehended vnder the name of Angells: which is common to all Angels both good and bad: But eſpecially the euill Angels are here meant, becauſe the drift of the Apoſtles
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:2715:113"/>
ſpeech neceſſarily requires that they ſhould be here more ſpecially intended, for the euill Angels are the ſpeciall inſtruments and chiefe procurers of all the dangers that tend to the ſeparation of vs <hi>from the loue of God in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> This is their maine reach and chiefe endeauour in all their practiſes againſt vs, to make this ſeparation, and therefore they muſt needes be here ſpecially intended in this challenge of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle. It were a ſmall comfort to the faithfull for the Apoſtle to ſay, that they were in ſafety, becauſe the good Angels ſhould not hurt them, for that were as much as if he ſhould ſay hee were in ſafety, becauſe his friends ſhould not hurt him, for the good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are our friends, and therefore will not hurt vs. But the Apoſtles reach is, to auouch the ſafety of Gods children againſt all dangers that are or can be againſt them, euen againſt the greateſt and fierceſt enemies that we haue; and therefore hee muſt needs meane it eſpecially of the euill Angels, becauſe they are the greateſt and fierceſt enemies that the faithfull haue. And thus the Apoſtle hath brought vs into the meditation of the ground of all our dangers and woes, and miſeries, namely, the euill Angels or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels. A fearefull and diſmall argument in it ſelfe, yet as it is here applyed by the Apoſtle, it is a chearefull and a comfortable argument. It is a fearefull and diſmall thing to heare of our enemies, but it is a comfortable thing to heare of the ouerthrow of them. Let not any of vs therefore be afraid to heare of them; we muſt not be afraid to fight with them, and therefore much leſſe to heare of them. One thing the Apoſtle tells vs here, as before wee haue
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:2715:114"/>
heard for our ſound comfort, that all theſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked fiends <hi>ſhall never bee able to ſeperate vs from the loue of God in Chriſt Ieſus</hi>; and therefore there is no cauſe why the weakeſt beleeuing ſoule here preſent ſhould be daunted at the hearing of this argument. Let vs therefore proceed in the ſtrength of God, and in the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and in the grace, and comfort, and direction of his holy ſpirit, and in the light and direction of Gods word, and we ſhall finde an heauenly light ariſe vnto vs out of this helliſh darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>The generall Doctrine concerning all Angels, good and bad, was the laſt time propounded, which being applyed to this particular, ariſeth naturally thus:<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> That howſoeuer it bee that euill Angells are mighty workers and great in power, and doe mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly bend all the power they haue againſt true beleeuers, to make this ſeparation of them from the <hi>loue of God in Chriſt</hi>; yet notwithſtanding not all the euill Angels, with all their power and malice, or all that they can doe, <hi>ſhall euer be able to ſeparate</hi> all, nor any one true beleeuer, <hi>from the loue of God which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the opening of this Doctrine I will propound theſe foure particulars, wherein I ſhall lay open the whole nature of the poynt. The firſt particular is, what theſe euill Angels are: The ſecond, how theſe euill Angels are fitted againſt vs: Thirdly, how they ſeeke to annoy vs: And laſtly, how farre they may endanger vs. For firſt, wee muſt know our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies what they are; and ſecondly, we muſt know their prouiſion, how they are fitted againſt vs; and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:2715:114"/>
then thirdly, we muſt know their courſes, how they may annoy vs; and laſtly, we muſt know the euent and iſſue, how farre they may endanger vs: Theſe being knowne, the Doctrine ſhall be well and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderſtood.</p>
               <p>Firſt, We muſt know what theſe euill Angels are.<note place="margin">Explication in foure things concerning the euill An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells.</note> The euill Angels are thoſe that left their firſt eſtate, and are become vtter enemies to God, and to man, and to all the creatures, eſpecially to Ieſus Chriſt, and to Gods children, and to all matter of grace and goodneſſe. Firſt, that they are ſuch as left their firſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> eſtate, we may ſee in <hi>Iude</hi> 6. Secondly, they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, for hence they haue their name Sathan, and there is no name more commonly giuen them both in the Olde and New Teſtament then this name Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, which ſignifieth an enemy. And howſoeuer this name in the Scripture ſeemes ſometime to poynt out the chiefe of Diuels, yet it doth appeare that it is applyed in Scripture to all Diuels, <hi>Math.</hi> 12.26. <hi>If Sathan caſt out Sathan,</hi> which is not meant of the Prince of Diuels, as if the Prince ſhould caſt out the Prince; but it is meant of all the Diuels, if they ſhould be one againſt another, then how ſhould their Kingdome ſtand? They are enemies, and they are vtter enemies, deadly enemies, and that firſt to God, diſhonouring him, accuſing him, blaſpheming him, oppoſing againſt him to the vttermoſt of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Secondly, they are enemies to man, they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered vs all with one blow, in the loynes of <hi>Adam,</hi> and not content with that they ſtill follow the blow, and purſue mankinde with deadly hatred. Thirdly, they are enemies to all the Creatures, ſeeking and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:2715:115"/>
working daily, as much as in them lyes, the vtter ruine and confuſion of the whole frame and order of nature in the Sea, in the winde, and in the aire, and in all places. Fourthly, they are ſpeciall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Ieſus Chriſt; this is that that galls theſe euill ſpirits, that IESVS CHRIST the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour betwixt God and man, comes to reconcile God to man, and to deliuer man out of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of theſe helliſh ſpirits; yea, and that hee doth vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroy and vanquiſh theſe euill ſpirits, and all that take part with them, euen all the powers or dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; here is their edge and ſtomacke; this heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſon Ieſus Chriſt in this heauenly office of the Mediatour, is the principall obiect of all their helliſh ſpight: They fought againſt him by themſelues, and by their inſtruments all his life, and at his death they layd on load, and did bend and muſter-vp all their forces, and ſpit out all their venome againſt him. Fiftly, they are enemies to Gods children, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a great eye-ſore to Sathan, they cannot endure them, and it is hard to ſay whether Sathan hate our heauenly Father more for our ſakes; or whether he hate vs the more for our heauenly Fathers ſake; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the Diuell is our aduerſary in a ſpecially man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Your aduerſary the Diuell,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, he is a generall accuſer, accuſing man to God, and God to man, but he is the ſpeciall accuſer of the brethren. Laſtly, he is an enemy to all grace and goodneſſe, he hinders it, he ſlanders it, he hates it, he ſuppreſſeth it with all his power, hee knowes that if grace and goodneſſe ſtand, he muſt fall, and therefore he labours to ouerthrow all grace and goodneſſe, that
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:2715:115"/>
he may ſtand. See this in one of his Impes, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.10. <hi>Elymas</hi> the Sorcerer, <hi>Oh childe of the Diuell</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle to him) <hi>enemy to all righteouſneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> If it be ſo with the Children, that they are enemies to all goodneſſe, much more is it ſo with their father the Diuell: So we ſee what theſe euill Angels are.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let vs ſee how they are fitted againſt vs,<note place="margin">2. In nine things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them.</note> for this is needfull to be knowne, that ſo we may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide againſt them. They haue many aduantages whereby they are fitted againſt vs; firſt, they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many; ſecondly, they are very ſtrong; thirdly, they are very malicious; fourthly, they are very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; fiftly, they are very actiue and nimble; ſixtly, they are very buſie; ſeauenthly, they are very wel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; eightly, they are very well experienced; and laſtly, they are very dangerous.</p>
               <p>Firſt, They are very many, <hi>Marke</hi> 5.9. <hi>One man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> was poſſeſt of a legion of Diuels</hi>; now a legion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines ſixe thouſand; what? ſo many Diuels in one poore man; how many thinke you are then in all the world? Any one Diuell is too hard for any one man, oh how hard then is that poore ſoule beſted that is aſſaulted with many Diuels? This is the caſe not of ſome of vs onely, but of all of vs, if we vnderſtand our caſe aright.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As they are very many, ſo they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſtrong, and therefore they are ſet out in Scripture vnder the ſimilitudes of a ſtrong man, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21. <hi>When a ſtrong man armed keepeth the pallace, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo of a ſtrong beaſt, yea, the ſtrongeſt of all Beaſts, a Lyon, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Your aduerſary the diuell as a roaring Lyon, &amp;c.</hi> and the hould which they haue in the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:2715:116"/>
heart of an vnregenerate man is ſaid to be a ſtrong hould, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. they are very ſtrong in getting the prey, it ſhall eſcape them hard but they will ſeize vpon vs, and they are very ſtrong in keeping the prey when once they haue ſeized, they will tug hard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will let goe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, They are very malicious, and therefore the Diuell is fitly ſet out vnto vs by the name of a <hi>great red Dragon, Reuel.</hi> 12.3. The Dragon of all Creatures is the moſt fierce, ſpightfull, and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: Sathans malice is greater then the Dragons, for he is a <hi>great</hi> Dragon, and more fierce then the malice of the Dragon, for he is <hi>a great red Dragon,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, as who ſhould ſay, that he burnes fiery red in malice alwaies againſt Gods Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, They are very ſubtle, and therfore they are compared to a Serpent, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 12.9. <hi>That olde Serpent called the Diuell and Sathan was caſt out, which deceiueth all the world</hi>; and the Serpent is very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Now the Serpent was more ſubtle, &amp;c.</hi> The Diuell is an olde ſubtle Serpent, ſo ſubtle that (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>he deceiues all the world</hi>; this hee hath done, and this he doth daily.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, They are very actiue and nimble, they are ſpirits by nature, and therefore by reaſon of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualneſſe and agility of their natures, they can and doe paſſe from place to place, quickely and ſodainly to and fro as the lightning. When <hi>Iob</hi> was to be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſee how nimbly Sathan beſtirred himſelfe, firſt to his Oxen in one place, then to his Sheep in another place, then to his Cammels in another place, and then to his children in another place, and all this in a
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:2715:116"/>
trice, in the turning of a hand as it were, <hi>Iob</hi> 1. And when our Sauiour Chriſt was to be tempted, how quickely did Sathan get him vp to the top of the pinacle of the temple, &amp; to the top of a high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, in the twinckling of an eye, ſaith the Text, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.5.6.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, he is very buſie, hee compaſſeth the world <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> to and fro, <hi>Iob</hi> 1.7. <hi>And walketh about ſeeking whom he may deuoure,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. When we ſit ſtill, he walkes about vs, when we are moſt at leaſure, he is moſt bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to doe vs miſchiefe, when we ſleepe, hee wakes, when our ſences are bound vp (as they are in our ſleepe) and the inmoſt powers of our ſoules are in ſome ſort lockt vp from him, yet then he leaues vs not, but euen in our ſleepe hee deludes our ſences with many idle and vaine imaginations, and polutes our thoughts with much filthines and vncleanneſſe.</p>
               <p>Seauenthly, they are very well appointed, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> are compared to a ſtrong man <hi>armed, Lu.</hi> 11.21. and if one be too weake of himſelfe, he can goe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently and take ſeauen ſpirits more to him worſe then himſelfe, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.26. and then he will be hard enough for vs. The Diuell hath all the world to his friend as he carryeth the matter, like a Spider that hath his Cop-web in euery corner of the houſe to catch the poore ſilly Flyes; ſo the Diuell hath his ſnares and Cop-webs in euery corner of the world to catch our poore ſinfull ſoules withall.</p>
               <p>Eightly, they are very well experienced, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> the Diuell is called <hi>the old Serpent, Reuel.</hi> 12 9. A mans experience is a great aduantage to him, though it be but of ſome few yeares; what wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:2715:117"/>
aduantage then is the Diuels experience againſt vs, which hee hath had ſince the beginning of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Laſtly, they are very dangerous, there is no more but a word and a blow with them; firſt, a temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then preſently an inclination, and then preſently a ſinne, and then hell and damnation: ſhort worke. This is alwayes Sathans intention in all his aſſaults, and this he euer brings to paſſe: where he hath his reach, and where he is not bridled by the ouer-ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hand of God, and therefore hee is called a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourer, a deſtroyer and a murtherer.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, we muſt know how they ſeeke to annoy vs,<note place="margin">Fiue particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars how the diuell annoyes vs.</note> ſurely they ſeeke to annoy vs euery way, at all times, and in all places, and in all ſtates and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and vpon all occaſions, and by all meanes and inſtruments; what is it that hee will not make an inſtrument to fight againſt vs withall?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, hee bends all his owne power, malice and ſubtilty againſt vs, and all the forces that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of darkeneſſe can afford, flattering, threatning, deluding, buffetting, tempting, vexing, and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vs, euen ſpending themſelues to doe vs a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, not content with this, he ſets the crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures againſt vs, the ſea, the winde and ſtormes and tempeſts all to annoy vs, afflict vs, croſſe vs, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet vs, yea, euen our meat and our drinke, and our bed, thoſe deare creatures of God which wee cannot liue without, he makes them to be a ſnare vnto vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, he increaſeth men againſt vs, to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute vs, to afflict vs, to tempt vs, yea ſometime our
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:2715:117"/>
owne deareſt friends, our owne wiues and children.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, not content with all this, hee ſets our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſelues againſt our ſelues, our appetite againſt our reaſon; the fleſh againſt the ſpirit, our practiſe againſt our iudgement, and our owne wils againſt our owne ſoules; and this is a moſt dangerous aſſault, for now they are our enemies, that are of our owne houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and till Sathan can come to this to make our ſelues againſt our ſelues, all his aſſaults can neuer hurt vs.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, as he ſeekes to ſet the whole world againſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> vs, ſo he proceedes further, and ſeekes to ſet God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs too. Let vs aſſure our ſelues, that Sathan is with God euery day, accuſing vs, and pleading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, and ſuing out a Commiſſion from God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, as he did againſt <hi>Iob,</hi> that hee may haue vs in his owne power, to doe his owne will vpon vs, and to hurt vs.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we muſt know how farre they may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> vs, ſurely they may endanger vs, ſo farre as God ſhall be pleaſed at any time to giue them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and no further, as God hath ſet a bound to the raging Sea, that thus farre his proud waues ſhall come, and no further: ſo God hath done to Sathan, and all the powers of darkeneſſe, thus farre they ſhall goe and no further: They may endanger vs to the ſpoyling of our goods, and to the hurt of our bodies, and to the diſtemper of our ſpirits, and ſometimes to the loſſe of our liues; but neuer to the loſſe of our ſoules: God giues way vnto them, that they may ſeperate vs from all worldly things; but hee neuer giues way vnto them to <hi>ſeperate vs from the loue of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:2715:118"/>
God in Chriſt Ieſus</hi>; which being the chiefe end of all their endeauours (for whatſoeuer meanes they vſe, this is the principall end they ayme at to <hi>ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate vs from the loue of God in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> being not able to attaine vnto it, here they are foyled, and this is their torment, and a ſpeciall portion of their hell in this world.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Proofes.</note>Now let vs come to the proofes: <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>I will put enmity betwixt thee and the woman, and betwixt thy ſeed and her ſeede, he ſhall breake thine head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heele.</hi> God himſelfe ſpeakes this to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans face, for his greater diſ-couragement: And the ſpeech containes two things; firſt, the enmity that ſhould be betwixt the woman &amp; the Serpent, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt their ſeeds, that is, betwixt Sathan &amp; mankind; ſecondly, the iſſue &amp; euent of it; the enmity in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the verſe, <hi>I will put enmity, &amp;c.</hi> where we ſee; firſt, that this is a mutuall enmity, that is, of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than againſt vs, and of vs againſt him, he ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe continuall enmity againſt vs, and we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe a continuall enmity againſt him: ſecondly, it is a deadly enmity, a deadly feude, as we ſay, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the perſons themſelues, but againſt their ſeed too, it is a deadly enmity neuer like to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, he and his ſeed, againſt vs and our ſeede, and we and our ſeed, againſt him and his ſeed. Thirdly, this emnity is of Gods own ordinance, <hi>I will put it,</hi> ſaith God, therefore neuer thinke it ſtrange that Sathan is ſuch a deadly enemy againſt vs, God hath ſo ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, neither muſt we thinke it much that wee are continually put to this fight againſt Sathan, for it is God that hath impoſed this condition vpon vs.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:2715:118"/>
Then the iſſue followes in the latter part of the verſe, <hi>It ſhall breake thine head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heele</hi>: Sathan ſhall but bruiſe her heele; hee may tempt and trouble, and diſquiet Gods children, and perſecute them, and take away their goods, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily their liues too, but this is nothing, it is but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle nibling at the heele, it is nothing in reſpect of our ſoule: It is but the heele that he can hurt, ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part, but he can neuer touch vs in our head, that is, in the hold that we haue in the loue of God through <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> But on the other ſide, <hi>the ſeed of the woman ſhall breake thine head,</hi> ſaith God; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than ſhall part with the greateſt loſſe; his head ſhall be broke, and his power deſtroyed, his purpoſes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, and at laſt himſelfe vtterly vanquiſhed and confounded; Here is ſtrong comfort for Gods children: Yea, but this is ſpoken of Chriſt himſelfe, he is the ſeed meant there: I anſwere, It is ſpoken of Chriſt indeed, but withall vnderſtand that in the caſe of Chriſt is ſet forth the caſe of euery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing ſoule, as Chriſt being the head, and wee the members, and therfore that which is done by Chriſt againſt Sathan, is done for vs, on our behalfe, and to our benefit, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Thou art Peter, and vpon this Rocke will I build my Church, and the gates of hell ſhall not preuaile againſt it.</hi> In the 16. verſe <hi>Peter</hi> had made a glorious confeſſion of ſauing faith, <hi>Thou art that Chriſt the Sonne of the liuing God</hi>: In this 18. verſe, our Sauiour quits him, and ſaith, <hi>Thou art Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp;c.</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Is it ſo <hi>Peter,</hi> that thou haſt this faith in thine heart to make this confeſſion of me? Then I ſay vnto thee, <hi>Thou art Peter, and vp

on this Rocke,</hi> that is, not vpon <hi>Peters</hi> perſon, nor vpon <hi>Peters</hi> confeſſion, <hi>but vpon the matter of his confeſsion, Chriſt Ieſus the Sonne of the liuing GOD, vpon this Rocke will I build my Church,</hi> that is, all true beleeuers, and that ſo firmely and ſurely, that all the gates (that is, all the powers of hell) ſhall neuer preuaile againſt <hi>it</hi> to ouerthrow <hi>it.</hi> Hell hath many gates, the gates of ſinne, &amp; death, and the Diuell; yet all theſe gates of hell, and all theſe powers of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhall neuer be able to ſhake off this building from this foundation, this Church from this Rocke, to ſeperate any one true beleeuing ſoule from the loue of God which is in <hi>Chriſt Ieſus our Lord</hi>; many other promiſes there are in the Scripture of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: yea, but theſe are but promiſes: If theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes doe not ſufficiently confirme our diſtruſtfull hearts in the perſwaſion of this heauenly truth ſee it by experience, and let that confirme vs.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Reuel.</hi> 12.7 to 11. <hi>verſe,</hi> where the holy Ghoſt ſets it downe as a thing already done, there is ſet downe a battaile and the ſucceſſe, the battaile in the 7. <hi>verſe, Michael and his Angels fought againſt the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, and the Dragon and his Angels fought.</hi> Here muſt needs be a great Battaile; when all the world is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into two parts, to fight one againſt another: What is the ſucceſſe? firſt, on the Dragons part, <hi>he preuailed not, verſe</hi> 8. hee was diſappointed of his purpoſe, all his labour againſt Gods children was loſt, and ſpent in vaine, and in the 9. <hi>verſe, hee was caſt out of Heauen,</hi> and his Angels with him; hee had a ſhamefull ouerthrow. The ſucceſſe in reſpect of the beleeuers what was that? firſt great ioy and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:2715:119"/>
in heauen, <hi>verſe</hi> 10. and ſecondly, a glorious conqueſt, <hi>verſe</hi> 11. they ouercame him: how? by that blood of that Lambe, &amp;c. This is the common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of Gods Church and children, and this euery true beleeuing ſoule ſhall ſurely finde in particular in his greateſt fight againſt ſinne and Sathan, from time to time, to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons of this point.<note place="margin">Reaſons.</note> There are no reaſons on our part, why Sathan doth not preuaile againſt vs, for we are ready to lye downe as beaſts, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray our owne ſoules, and to be taken of him at his pleaſure: no, all our ſtay and ſafety is meerely through God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The firſt Reaſon is this, God by his power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and limits the power of Sathan, as we may ſee in <hi>Iob</hi> 1. and 2. Chapters; when hee lets him looſe vpon <hi>Iob,</hi> it is with reſtraint ſtill, all that he hath is in thy power, onely vpon himſelfe put not forth thy hand, <hi>Iob</hi> 1.12. And in the 2. <hi>Chapter</hi> and 6. <hi>Verſe, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold he is in thine hand, but ſaue his life.</hi> Now the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God is more mighty to helpe vs, then the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Sathan is to hurt vs, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.4. <hi>Hee is greater that is in vs, then he that is in the world:</hi> and except the Lord ſhould thus limit and binde the power of Sathan, no man liuing could euer ſtand againſt him: God reſtraines him and keepes him as a Lyon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in barres and grates.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he reſtraines their rage and malice, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> he did, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.33. where he turned the rage of the Diuels, from the man that was poſſeſt with them, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſwine: Gods goodneſſe is more able and ready to preſerue vs, then Sathans malice is to deſtroy vs.</p>
               <p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, God defeats the plots and purpoſes of theſe euill ſpirits, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3.1.2. his wiſedome ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaches all their ſubtilties, and watches ouer vs more effectually to ſaue, then they with all their ſubtilties can doe to caſt vs away.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, God endues vs with grace and ſtrength from aboue, to reſiſt and ſtand faſt, that they may not preuaile againſt vs; for it is not our owne ſtrength we ſtand by, but it is the power of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. <hi>His grace and his power is all-ſufficient to preſerue vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The laſt maine Reaſon is from Chriſt himſelfe, for he is Sathans vanquiſher, and he is our Captaine and Protector, and therefore it muſt needes follow that Sathan ſhall be ouerthrowne, and neuer preuaile; and that we ſhall neuer be ouerthrowne but euer preuaile: That Chriſt himſelfe is Sathans vanquiſher and ouercommer, we may ſee in that, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Hee ſhall breake Sathans head, Rom.</hi> 16.20. <hi>He ſhall treade Sathan vnder our feet ſhortly,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.8. <hi>He it is that doth looſe and vndoe the workes of the Diuell:</hi> he foyled the Diuell hand to hand in all his temptations, <hi>Math.</hi> 4.11. And he it was that rebuked the Diuell, and caſt out thoſe foule ſpirits in his life, as appeares in many ſtories of the Goſpell: And at his death, he it was that deſtroyed them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>He deſtroyed through death, him that had the power of death, that is the Diuell,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; at his death he ſpoyled them, and triumphed ouer all the powers of darkeneſſe openly vpon the Croſſe, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.16. therefore Sathan muſt needs be ouercome, &amp; can neuer preuaile. Secondly, Chriſt is our Captaine and Protector, and therefore we cannot be ouercome, but muſt needs preuaile,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:2715:120"/>
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 22.42. Sathan deſires to winnow euery one of vs, that is, to deſtroy vs; but <hi>I haue prayed for you</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour) <hi>that your faith faile</hi> not. Sathan he is a daily Sutor to God againſt vs, Chriſt Ieſus hee ſupports vs, and is a continuall Sutor to his heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father for vs; Now, if the Diuell ſhall be heard before Chriſt Ieſus, then we may periſh: But if Chriſt Ieſus ſhall be heard in heauen before the Diuell; then it is vtterly impoſſible that euer the euill Angels ſhould preuaile againſt vs.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, It is for reproofe of ſome others, that are onely fearefull and timerous of their owne parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular eſtate, that ſay in themſelues, oh! ſurely I ſhall fall away from God; though the Diuell be not able to plucke away others from God, yet he may pluck me away, the wicked fiend haunts me ſore, and ſurely hee will plucke mee away from God before he hath done with me: Poore ſoules, they would faine come neerer to God, and be better perſwaded of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, but they dare not be ſo bold, or cannot be ſo ſtrong: Well, come and let vs reaſon together: Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than thou ſaieſt will neuer let thee alone, he is alwaies tempting thee, and therefore hee will at laſt ſurely plucke thee away from God: Oh thou of little faith, why doeſt thou thus vexe and wrong thy ſelfe? why wilt thou giue ſentence with thine enemy againſt thy ſelfe? Is it not enough for the Diuell to bragge and boaſt that he can pull thee out of Gods hands, but thou wilt beleeue him, and giue ſentence on his ſide, and ſay as he ſaith?

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:2715:121"/>
thou beeſt a true beleeuer, doeſt daily grow in grace and ſo art more able to ſtand faſt euery day then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though happily thou feeleſt it not; and the diuell is weaker and more hartleſſe euery day then other againſt thee, as hauing laboured in vain all this while, why therfore art thou thus diſcouraged? beleeue not Sathan, checke thy ſelfe for this vnbeleeuing heart, and gather better ſpirits, and put on more comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reſolutions, caſt thy ſoule and ſtate confidently on the Lord in faith in Chriſt, and in obedience to his will, aſſure thy ſelfe, that thou being a beleeuing ſoule, God hath ſet his marke vpon thee, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſt thou vpon him, and all theſe euill Angells ſhall neuer be able to plucke thee out of the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his loue in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond vſe is for comfort, here is matter of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>2</label> ſound and ſinguler conſolation to all true beleeuers. Firſt, againſt euill Angels themſelues; ſecondly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their temptations; thirdly, againſt our ſinnes: Sathan is the euill Angell, his temptations are his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments whereby he workes, and ſin is his worke; here is our comfort, that neither Sathan himſelfe, nor his inſtruments, nor his works, ſhal euer preuaile againſt vs, to plucke vs away from God. Firſt, here is matter of comfort againſt Sathan himſelfe, and all the aduantages he hath againſt vs feare them not, for they ſhall neuer be able to caſt thee out of the eſtate of grace, and of Gods loue. Lift vp thy heart and conſider how God hath furniſhed thee with particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar comforts againſt al the particular aduantages that the euill ſpirits haue againſt thee: Firſt, thou wilt ſay, the euiil Angels are very many; true, but what then?
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:2715:122"/>
Did not Chriſt euen with one word caſt out a Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Diuels at once out of one man? <hi>Marke</hi> 5.8. then neuer feare them for their multitude; that one onely God is infinitely more than innumerable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils; Yea, but ſecondly, they are very ſtrong: It is true, Sathan is the ſtrong man indeed, but Chriſt is a ſtronger man, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.22. and ouercommeth him; The Diuell is a roaring Lyon; it is true, yea, but Chriſt is a Lyon too, &amp; a ruling &amp; raigning Lyon, he is the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> the royall Tribe, he rules all, and he makes that other Lyon the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell when he comes in preſence to crie out and roare for feare and anger, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.33.34. an vncleane Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell cryed out with a loud voyce, ſaying, <hi>Oh! what haue wee to doe with thee? &amp;c.</hi> therefore neuer feare them for their ſtrength; Yea, but thirdly, they are very malicious againſt vs, what then? God is very louing and gratious to vs: If the King fauour any man, and carry a ſpeciall loue towards him, what though the ſubiect hate and maligne him, the Kings fauour will keepe him farre enough out of the reach of their malice; and is not the loue and fauour of God to his children a farre greater ſhelter from the Diuels malice? Fourthly, yea, but they are very ſubtile; what though they be? There is no ſubtilty can ſtand againſt God: Chriſt is our wiſdome 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. and therefore what need we feare their ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Yea, but they are very actiue and nimble, they can ſpeedily paſſe from one place to another; what then? God is alwaies preſent in all places alike; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer thou art, God is there preſent and ready to keepe thee, before euer the Diuell can come at thee
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:2715:122"/>
to annoy thee: Yea, but ſixtly, they are very buſie and watchfull they ſleepe not: It is true, behold al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, <hi>He that keepeth Iſrael neuer ſlumbreth nor ſleepeth.</hi> The Diuell alwayes watcheth ouer vs for euill, and not for good; but our heauenly Father alwaies watcheth ouer vs for good, and not for euill, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore feare them not: Yea, but ſeauenthly, they are very well prouided and appointed againſt vs; It is true, but I hope heauen is better appointed &amp; furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed then hel: What is all their prouiſion, to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion of the Lord of hoſtes, that hath all Creatures of heauen and earth at his full command? Yea, but eightly, they haue very much experience: Yea, but what is their experience which they haue gotten in ſome fiue or ſixe thouſand yeares, to match with the knowledge and wiſedome of God, which hath beene from all eternity? The Diuell knowes vs, and our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions and diſpoſitions, but as a ſpie, and as a capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cenſurer: but God knowes vs as our maker and Ruler, and gracious diſpoſer of all our wayes; Why therefore ſhould we feare Sathan for his long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? Yea, but laſtly, they are very dangerous: It is true, where Sathan rules hee is ſo, but God will plucke his children out of their pawes and clutches, as a prey to himſelfe, and make them dwell ſafely vnder the ſhadow of his wings; why then ſhould we be diſcomforted at the dangerouſneſſe of theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies? Therefore feare none of theſe aduantages, which the euill ſpirits haue againſt vs, for we ſee wee haue particular comforts in Scripture againſt them all. Wherefore, all you that are true beleeuers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort your ſelues in God, your eſtate is good, and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:2715:123"/>
your ſaluation ſure through Gods mercy, euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the diuels in hell; And therefore let vs bee perſwaded reſolutely of it, and comforted through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by it, and bleſſe God for euer for it, through Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly. This ſerues alſo to comfort vs againſt the temptations of Sathan, which are his engines and inſtruments, ſurely we are in ſafety againſt theſe alſo; for if the euill ſpirits themſelues cannot plucke vs from God, but that wee are in ſafety againſt them, then comfort your ſelues, ye are in ſafety alſo againſt all their engines too; all their temptations ſhall not doe it; I doe not ſay, that Gods children ſhall not be tempted at all; for they muſt neuer looke to be free from temptation while they are on the earth, if they be Gods children; but I ſay, here is a warrant for vs that we ſhall neuer be vtterly ouercome by Sathans temptations. Tell me, thou true-beleeuing ſoule, that haſt true faith, though it be but little, art thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that God loues thee in Chriſt? Thou wilt ſay yes, I am; why, then tell me further, if God doe loue thee, canſt thou euer thinke that God will euer ſuffer thee to bee caſt away by a ſcuruy temptation of a curſed diuell? I aske it thee againe; if God doe loue thee, canſt thou euer thinke that he will ſuffer thee to be caſt away by any ſcuruy temptation of a curſed diuell? No, he cannot, nor he will not; it is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, as for heauen to be ſwallowed vp of hell; <hi>God knowes how to deliuer his</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle,) either God will preuent the temptation, that wee ſhall not be tempted at all; or if we be, God will quallifie the temptation, that it ſhall not be too ſtrong againſt vs;
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:2715:123"/>
or elſe he will giue vs ſtrength againſt the ſtrongeſt temptation, that it ſhall not be too hard for vs; or if we be ouer-matched with the temptation for a while, yet God will recouer vs by his ſpirit, and make vs to take better hold of him for the time to come, and ſo the iſſue ſhall be good: All this God hath paſt his word for, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>God is faithfull, which will not ſuffer vs to be tempted aboue that we are able, but will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen giue an iſſue with the temptation, &amp;c.</hi> God hee pawnes his faithfulneſſe for the confirmation of it, therefore let vs embrace this heauenly truth, and build ſurely vpon it, and take ſound comfort in it, and then we ſhall moſt ſurely be ſafe againſt all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans temptations.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is comfort to vs againſt our ſinnes, they are the Diuels workes, and theſe ſhall not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate vs from GOD wholly: For ſome man might ſay, <hi>Paul</hi> thou telleſt vs all this while that the euill Angels ſhall not ſeperate vs from God; But what comfort is this? <hi>Our ſinnes they doe ſeparate vs from God, Iſay</hi> 59.2. What ſayeſt thou to them? But the Apoſtle knew what he ſaid, for if we be ſafe from the euill Angels themſelues, then ſurely we are ſafe from their workes; if any thing can ſeparate vs from God, then ſinne can; and if ſinne can, then the euill Angels can: But the euill Angels cannot, &amp; therfore ſinne which is their worke cannot: So farre as ſinne preuailes, ſo farre it may ſeparate vs; if it preuaile for a time, then it ſeparates vs for a time from God, that is, in our ſence and feeling, but ſuch breaches are made vp by daily repentance, faith, and Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion; but if it preuaile for euer, then it will ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:2715:124"/>
vs for euer from God, but they cannot preuaile ouer the faithfull for euer: But when the Apoſtle tels vs the euill Angels ſhall neuer ſeparate vs from God; it is as much, as if he had ſaid, that God will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vs to be wholly ouer-come of ſinne, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.9. nor to fall into thoſe ſins that may ſeparate vs whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from him, for then the euill Angels may ſeparate, if ſinne may, which is their worke, Here is the loue of God in Chriſt; firſt, Gods loue, and loue couers a multitude of ſinnes, it is ſo with men, much more with God; and ſecondly, Chriſt Ieſus he takes away our ſinnes, and hath pulled downe the partition-wall of our ſinnes, that they cannot ſeparate vs from God: So wee ſee that neither the euill Angels themſelues, nor their temptations, nor ſinne can euer ſeperate vs from God. Theſe comforts God affoords vs in his word for his children, and therefore let vs take hold of them: And now that wee are to come to the Sacrament, what vſe are we to make of it? The Sacrament is a ſeale of Gods word; then make this vſe of it, to ſeale vp that word to our ſoules that we haue now heard: the Sacrament ſeales &amp; ſweares to vs that all is true that God ſaith in his Word; the Sacrament is a pledge and token that God giues vs of the truth of his Word: Haſt thou heard then that all the euill Angels with all their power and malice, ſhall neuer be able to ſeperate thee from the loue of GOD in IESVS CHRIST? then now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Sacrament as a ſeale thereof, that as verily as thou receiueſt the Bread and Wine, ſo truely doſt thou receiue the Body and Blood of Chriſt, that is the benefit &amp; the merits thereof, the loue and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:2715:124"/>
of God in Chriſt, and therefore take Chriſt here, and take all things with him; He that giues thee Chriſt in the Sacrament, giues thee all things with him, <hi>grace, mercy, peace, comfort, forgiueneſſe of ſinnes,</hi> and what not? Therefore let vs now make vſe of the Sacrament to ſeale vp the truth of Gods word to vs, that we haue now heard, and let vs intreat God to ſtirre vp our hearts to a holy vſe of it, that ſo it may aſſure vs of the certainety of our ſaluation, and let vs not liſſen to Sathan, but let vs hearken to God in his word and Sacrament, that ſo we may ſtand faſt, and <hi>hauing fought a good fight, and finiſhed our courſe,</hi> wee may enioy the Crowne of life, which God will giue vs at that day.</p>
               <p>The laſt Vſe is for Inſtruction, teaching vs to vſe <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>3</label> the meanes, for the procuring and enioying of this ſafety; for though it be certainely confirmed, that the euill ſpirits ſhall neuer preuaile againſt vs, neither by themſelues, their temptations, or ſinnes, to <hi>ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate vs from the loue of God in Chriſt Ieſus</hi>; yet ſuch meanes muſt of neceſſity be vſed whereby this end may be attained vnto: and take this for a warning, that they that are not carefull to vſe the meanes in ſome true meaſure, may iuſtly ſuſpect that as yet they haue not any knowne intereſt in this priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: And therefore here we muſt learne, firſt, what wee are to auoyde; ſecondly, what wee are to doe, that ſo we may enioy this ſafety: and thirdly, the meanes to helpe vs in both theſe. Firſt, what wee are to auoide; and firſt, doe not thou dare-them nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke them; It is not good to prouoke Waſpes and Hornets, but it is much worſe to prouoke Diuels.
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:2715:125"/>
Some rude people will dare the Diuell, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, and bid the wicked fiend to come if he dare, aqd to doe his worſt, &amp;c. Silly wretches, the Diuell laughes at them, to ſee how foole-hardy they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, that hath them in his clutches already: Nay beloued theſe enemies are eager enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs of themſelues, they need no prouocation; as long as he is the challenger of vs, and giues the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet on vs, we haue our warrant to fight againſt him, and a promiſe of protection and deliuerance: But when we are the challengers, and giue the on-ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, if euer we be foyled, as vſually it ſo fals out, it was our owne ſeeking, and wee haue our mends in our owne hands. Secondly, raile not at him, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile him; though he come againſt thee as <hi>Goliah,</hi> ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt the liuing God, curſing &amp; blaſpheming, yet doe thou goe againſt him as <hi>Dauid,</hi> peaceably, and holily, in the name of the Lord of hoſtes, and then be ſure of victory; Learne of the Arch-Angel, <hi>Iude</hi> 9. <hi>Not to raile againſt the Diuell,</hi> but ſay as hee ſaid, <hi>the Lord rebuke thee</hi>; and if it be ſpoken in faith, it is the ſoareſt ſneape, that thou canſt giue him: not I defie thee, avaunt curſed fiend, and ſuch like; theſe are but bug-beares: but this, <hi>the Lord rebuke thee,</hi> being vttered by faith on earth, and anſwered by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in heauen, quailes him ſoundly. Thirdly, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon not with him, if once he can bring thee to parlee with him, as hee did <hi>Eue,</hi> then he hath halfe catcht thee already; he is a cunning Sophiſter, he will put many trickes and fallaſies vpon thee: And hee is a ſtrong reaſoner; no man is able to anſwere him in reaſon, though he ſhould vſe no deceit. Fourthly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:2715:125"/>
him not, whatſoeuer he ſaith, wilt thou beleeue a common lyer? he is the common father of lyes, and of lyers too; though he ſpeake truth, beleeue him not in the ſpeaking of it, for he hath ſome ſiniſter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in it, and ſo he lies euen in ſpeaking truth. This is the firſt Inlet of Sathan into the heart, to beleeue his ſuggeſtions, and therefore beleeue nothing that comes from him, hold him not parlee, and hee ſhall neuer hurt thee. Laſtly, giue no way to him, no, not in the leaſt paſſage; he is a ſubtile ſerpent, if hee get in but the head, but the faſtening of an euill motion vpon thee, he will ſoone winde in the whole body.</p>
               <p>Secondly, here we muſt learne what is to be done that we may be in ſafety againſt theſe euill ſpirits:</p>
               <p>Firſt, we muſt ſtand faſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we muſt reſiſt; but you will ſay, what cares he for any reſiſtance? yes, he doth, <hi>Iames</hi> 4.7. <hi>Reſiſt the Diuell, and he will flye from you.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8.9. <hi>Your aduerſary the Diuell, as a roaring Lyon walketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſeeking whom he may deuour.</hi>
